  <title>Verify - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/cloud/verify</url>
  <content>Verify API is a security-focused feature that allows wallets to notify end-users when they may be connecting to a suspicious or malicious domain, helping to prevent phishing attacks across the industry.

Once a wallet knows whether an end-user is on uniswap.com or eviluniswap.com, it can help them to detect potentially harmful connections through Verify’s combined offering of Reown’s domain registry.

Cloud Verification
------------------

In order to verify your app domain in Reown Cloud follow these steps:

1.  Head over to [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/)
    
2.  Create a new project or click on the project you would like to verify.
    
3.  On the settings tab, head over to the ‘Domain verification’ section and fill in the website URL that you wish to verify.
    

4.  Click on the copy button and head over to your domain Name Registrar/Provider to edit your DNS records. Alternatively, if you can’t manage DNS records for your project (eg: ENS or vercel.app) you can host a static file under `/.well-known/walletconnect.txt` which contains the entire verification code that you copied. If you are using the static file method, you can jump over step 7.
    
5.  Under `Type`, select `TXT`. In the “Answer” section, paste the text you copied from the cloud dashboard. This field may vary across DNS dashboards. If you’re trying to register a subdomain, add it under `Host`. Feel free to leave TTL at its default value.
    

6.  Depending on your DNS settings, this might take a while to reflect. You can check out DNS settings for your website with CLI tools like Dig or with websites like [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=txt)
    
7.  Once this is done and you have confirmed this change is reflected, head on back to your Cloud Dashboard and click on Verify.
    

8.  You should see a toast pop up in the bottom right section of your screen and the domain verification section should have a green tick next to it.</content>

<page>
  <title>Relay - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/cloud/relay</url>
  <content>Project ID
----------

The Project ID is consumed through URL parameters.

URL parameters used:

*   `projectId`: Your Project ID can be obtained from [cloud.reown.com](https://cloud.reown.com/)

Example URL:

`https://relay.walletconnect.com/?projectId=c4f79cc821944d9680842e34466bfbd`

This can be instantiated from the client with the `projectId` in the `SignClient` constructor.

Allowlist
---------

To help prevent malicious use of your project ID you are strongly encouraged to set an allowlist of [origins](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin) or application/bundle ids for mobile applications where the project ID is used. Requests from other origins will be denied.

*   Allowlist supports a list of origins in the format `[scheme://]<hostname[:port]`.
*   [Application ID](https://developer.android.com/build/configure-app-module#set-application-id)/[Bundle IDs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/bundle_ids) typically are defined using the [reverse domain name notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation)

Using `localhost` (or `127.0.0.1`) is always permitted, and if empty all origins are allowed. Updates take 15 minutes to apply.

If scheme or port is specified, it must match exactly. Hostname must also match exactly, but wildcards can be used for individual labels within the hostname.

Example of possible origins in the allowlist:

*   `example.com` - allows `https://example.com` or `http://example.com` but not `https://www.example.com`
*   `https://example.com` - allows `https://example.com` but not `http://example.com`
*   `https://www.example.com` - allows `https://www.example.com` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://example.com:8080` - allows `https://example.com:8080` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://*.example.com` - allows `https://www.example.com` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://*.*.example.com` - allows `https://www.subdomain.example.com` but not `https://www.example.com` or `https://example.com`
*   `https://www.*.example.com` - allows `https://www.subdomain.example.com` but not `https://www.example.com`
*   `https://www-*.example.com` - invalid; `*` must be the full label

Error Codes
-----------

| Reason | Error Code |
| --- | --- |
| Project ID doesn’t exist OR JWT is expired | 401 |
| Exists and is invalid | 403 |
| Too many requests | 1013 |

Websocket Close Codes
---------------------

| Code | Description | Reconnect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1001 | Server terminating | Yes |
| 4008 | Client stale: connected without a prior subscription and is not sending data | When needed |
| 4010 | Load Rebalancing | Yes |

Best Practices
--------------

*   Create a new `projectId` for each project. This allows for more granular control, dedicated explorer listings, and project metrics.
*   Don’t reuse a `projectId`.
*   Use the AllowList to limit unauthorized usage.
*   Avoid committing projects keys to the repo. Use env variables instead.

  <title>Push Server - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/advanced/push-server</url>
  <content>The Push Server sends WalletConnect protocol activity using FCM or APNs to users. The Push Server can be used with our [WalletKit SDK](https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/overview).

Several options exist for setting up the Push Server:

1.  Using [Reown Cloud](https://docs.reown.com/_sites/docs.reown.com/advanced/push-server#setup-in-walletconnect-cloud) (recommended)
2.  Self-host the [Push Server](https://github.com/WalletConnect/push-server)
3.  Write your own implementation using the [spec](https://specs.walletconnect.com/2.0/specs/servers/push/spec)

It is recommended that you use Reown Cloud for simplicity and ease of integration. Typically you only need to self-host if you have concerns about our hosted platform having access to your FCM or APNs server credentials, such as for regulatory reasons. If you want to self-host or implement against the spec, please reach out to [devrel@walletconnect.com](mailto:devrel@walletconnect.com) for assistance.

Setup in Reown Cloud
--------------------

1.  Create a Project in the Cloud App. Go to [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/) and sign up for an account.
    
2.  To get your project’s Push URL, from the Cloud App, go into the settings tab and click on `Create Push URL`.
    

3.  From the same settings tab, you will see the FCM and the APNS settings becomes available to setup. Add your \[FCM\](#Firebase Cloud Messaging API (FCM v1)) and/or [APNs](https://docs.reown.com/_sites/docs.reown.com/advanced/push-server#apple-push-notifications-apns) details.

### Firebase Cloud Messaging API (FCM v1)

*   In your [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/) project settings, under _Firebase Cloud Messaging API (V1)_, click the Manage Service Accounts link
*   You may use the default `firebase-adminsdk` service account, but we recommend making a new, minimally privileged, service account. Eg a ready-made role from Firebase `Firebase Cloud Messaging API Admin` would only give access to messaging and notifications:
    *   Click the _Create service account_ button
    *   Provide an arbitrary name and ID. E.g. `Reown Cloud Push Server` and click _Create and Continue_
    *   Select the `Firebase Cloud Messaging API Admin` role and click _Continue_
    *   Click Done
*   Next create keys for the service account by clicking on the `⋮` button next to the service account and selecting _Manage keys_
    *   Click _Add key_ -> _Create new key_
    *   Select _JSON_ and click _Create_
    *   A `.json` file containing the service account credentials will be automatically downloaded to your computer
*   Upload the credentials JSON file to your Cloud project’s FCM V1 settings and click _Save_

You should now see a green checkbox indicating that FCM V1 has been enabled! Now any clients that register themselves on the Push Server will receive FCM push notifications for relay messages to that client.

### Cloud Messaging API (FCM Legacy)

Google’s FCM allows you to use send notifications to both Android and Apple devices. At this time, we only support apps using the FCM client API.

*   Enable Legacy Cloud Messaging API in the Firebase project settings
*   [Set up Android](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/client)
*   [Set up Apple](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/ios/client)

### Apple Push Notifications (APNs)

Apple recommends using a Token-Based Connection for APNS over a Certificate-Based connection. Please refer to their documentation for instructions on obtaining either.

*   [Token-Based Connection](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/establishing_a_token-based_connection_to_apns)
*   [Certificate-Based Connection](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/establishing_a_certificate-based_connection_to_apns)</content>

  <title>User Management - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/cloud/user-management</url>
  <content>Easily view and manage all authenticated users through AppKit [Cloud Auth SIWX](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/authentication/siwx/siwx-cloud-auth), a drop-in hosted SIWX server that provides key insights into your user base.

Usage
-----

Refer to [Cloud Auth SIWX](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/authentication/siwx/siwx-cloud-auth) for instructions on enabling this feature with AppKit.

Dashboard
---------

The dashboard provides a list of all accounts (chain + address) connected to your dapp, including the country they connected from, the last connection time, and the authentication method (wallet or social login).

Insights
--------

We plan to add more insights over time. Currently, it includes:

*   **Connections**: Authenticated users over time
*   **Geographic Distribution**: User distribution by country
*   **Wallet Analytics**: Which wallets are most commonly used
*   **30-Day History**: Historical data for the past 30 days

SIWX API
--------

The Cloud Auth SIWX API is a hosted server implementing [Sign In With X/Anything (SIWX)](https://chainagnostic.org/CAIPs/caip-122). SIWX is a chain-agnostic variant of [Sign In With Ethereum (SIWE)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361). To connect to your dapp, users must sign a message. The message signature is forwarded to our server, which verifies it and issues a JWT upon successful authentication.

Why Use Our API Instead of Building Your Own?
---------------------------------------------

Our solution abstracts the complexity and maintenance costs of running a SIWX server. Another benefit is immediate access to key user insights in your dashboard, as shown above. The API leverages Cloudflare Workers for global distribution and has built-in rate limiting.

Limitations
-----------

Currently, this feature and its API are only available for AppKit projects and only supports EVM networks. We plan to make it available for all Reown projects and will add more networks in upcoming versions. Get in touch via Discord if you are interested.

Programmatic Access & Webhooks
------------------------------

We are planning on enabling your backend to interact with our hosted backend via [OIDC](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/). This allows you to confirm whether a user is logged in and qualify their scopes.

We are also planning on exposing the list of users programmatically and webhooks such that you can subscribe to signup, login, and other events.</content>

  <title>Paymaster - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/cloud/paymaster</url>
  <content>Accessing Reown Paymaster
-------------------------

1.  Log in to your Cloud Account [here](https://cloud.reown.com/sign-in).
2.  Click on your Project, then select the “Paymaster” Tab.

Creating a Policy
-----------------

Click on “Add Policy” and follow the steps within the policy creation screen.

### 1\. Select a Plan

#### Free Plan

If you select the free plan, you will have _unlimited_ access to sponsoring on testnets. Currently, only Sepolia is supported.

#### Pay-As-You-Go

With the Pay-as-you-go plan, you will be asked to enter credit card information. _You will not be billed immediately_.

Instead you will be charged based on usage, with Paymaster Credits. This is calculated using a simple formula:

*   amount of gas sponsored + fee

### 2\. Add Policy Basic Info

1.  Write a descriptive name for your policy
2.  Add a start date for your policy. The current date and time are selected by default. However, you can set a future date and time to align your policy’s start with a campaign or similar event.
3.  Optionally, add an end date, and your policy will automatically lapse on that date.

### 3\. Select Chains

All supported chains are enabled by default, but you can deselect any chain to sponsor transactions only on specific chains.

#### Currently Supported Mainnet Chains

*   Ethereum
*   Polygon
*   Avalanche
*   Mantle
*   Celo
*   Optimism
*   Base
*   Zora
*   Gnosis
*   Metis

#### Currently Supported Testnet Chains

*   Sepolia

### 4\. Add Policy Logic

Policy logic can be updated in one of two ways:

1.  No-code policy builder
2.  JSON editor

There are distinct advantages to this:

1.  You can maintain an auditable history of your policies by storing the JSON files for each policy.
2.  You can auto-generate policies for your campaigns, as it’s a straightforward JSON schema.
3.  Policies are highly flexible, allowing you to chain conditional checks to target specific smart contracts, particular methods within a contract, expected gas limits, and more.

Once created, the policy will become active immediately if the start date has already passed, making it ready for use.

#### Using the no code builder

All that is required is to

1.  Input the contract address
2.  Paste the ABI
3.  Select the methods you wish to sponsor via the drop down
4.  _IMPORTANT_: If you would like to sponsor the deployment of smart accounts on your app, tick the `Sponsor Smart Account Deployment` checkbox.

Based on [EIP 5792](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-5792.md) and [ERC 7677](https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-7677.md), utilizing a paymaster is as simple as providing the paymaster RPC URL.

The Paymaster screen includes an `RPC URL` selector for chain-specific URLs. All URLs follow the same format, varying only by chain ID, so you can generate the URL in your Dapp based on the active chain.

### Policy Selection

By default, all policies will be validated in succession until one returns true.

There is the option of passing `policyId` in the optional to the RPC. This can be sent by the dapp via the the `context` field per [ERC 7677](https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-7677.md). However - please note that different paymasters may accept `policyId` with a different key or format. For Reown’s Paymaster, that key is `policyId`.

JSON Schema: A Practical Example Walkthrough
--------------------------------------------

### Basics

The schema itself is a simple object representation of the following

> Is some key from a user operation equivalent to _(or some other comparison)_ some value?

This is defined in `params` as such:

### Chaining Conditionals

The flexibility here lies in the ability to chain different conditionals together. For example, you can check if the User Op targets a specific smart contract and a particular function within that contract’s ABI. Since these fields are encoded within a UserOp’s `callData`, two different methods are needed to access this information:

1.  `callDataMethodEquals`: Verifies that the `callData` targets a specific function
2.  `callDataToEquals`: Verifies that the `callData` targets a specific contract

Essentially, we want to combine the following two conditions:

To do this, we need to zoom out and see how to set the `params`:

The new field we introduced here is `ands`. The way the schema is designed, Each `params` object, can be accompanied with an `ands` OR an `ors` field which is an array of more params that will require that they either all pass as true, or only one of them is true, respectively.

A `params` object can not have both an `ors` and an `ands` simultaneously. However, its “children” (the params in an `ands` or `ors`) can have different conditionals than their parent.

For example, to make it so that the above policy also passes for `methodBar` and `methodBaz`, it can be amended as follows:

This essentially is a schema translation of

> The UserOp should target smart contract 0xa123.. and either use the methods `methodFoo` or `methodBar` or `methodBaz`.

Note that at the top it used `ands` and then used `ors` for the children. This is fully legal within the schema.

However, the following is incorrect :

_**In this case, the `ors` will be completely ignored. If both `ors` and `ands` are present, then the `ands` will take precedence.**_

### ABI Parsing

For the policy to actually know how to read the `callData` it needs to know the smart contract’s ABI.

For this we introduce 2 new fields. `policyStaticProps` and `metadata`. Both are essentially free range key-value dictionaries used to store information within the policy to be accessed later. The key thing to note is that values within `policyStaticProps` can be accessed from within `metadata`. This becomes invaluable with policies that have multiple conditionals like the one above.

Essentially here, `contractAbi` is a variable that `callDataMethodEquals` requires. To supplement its value, we use `<contract1.abi>`. What `<contract1.abi>` means is essentially `policyStaticProps.contract1.abi`. The `<>` indicate that this value is coming from `policyStaticProps`.

Note that the values within `policyStaticProps` can be named anything. The only constraint is that `contractAbi` is named the same within the metadata as that is what `callDataMethodEquals` will look for.

Extrapolating this to our running example above, the complete policy becomes:

### Housekeeping

The final bit to making a valid policy is adding `metadata` to the root of your policy, to keep basic metadata like what chains to support, the startTime and endTime.

Adding this to the above gives us a complete and working policy.

### Complete Example Policy

The following is the culmination of all the above steps to create a complete policy.

In English, what this policy is saying is

> The policy starts on the 23rd of October 2024, does not expire and will support Ethereum, Polygon and Testnet. For a UserOp to pass this policy, it needs to be targeting smart contract `0xa123cd918...` **and** it has to be using One of the following methods from the contract: `methodFoo` **or** `methodBar` **or** `methodBaz`.

JSON Schema: Definitions
------------------------

### `policyType`

The type of policy, currently only `useroperation_payload_control` is available.

### `policyStaticProps`

Key value pair used as data storage for the policy

### `params`

Where the core logic of a policy lives

#### `key`

The key within the UserOp to target, currently only EntryPoint v.07 is supported, so the available fields are:

1.  `sender`
2.  `nonce`
3.  `callData`
4.  `callGasLimit`
5.  `verificationGasLimit`
6.  `maxFeePerGas`
7.  `maxPriorityFeePerGas`

#### `op`

The operation to apply within the params. Currently available:

1.  `equals`: Exact 1:1 match with `value`
2.  `lessThanOrEquals`: Is the numeric value less than or equals `value`
3.  `callDataMethodEquals`: Within `callData`, is the `method` equal to a `value`
    *   requires `contractAbi` defined in `metadata`
4.  `callDataToEquals`: Within `callData`, is the `to` equal to a `value`

#### `value`

The value to be compared to. Can be a string, number or boolean.

### `ands`

Array consisting of policies (with `policyType` and `policyStaticProps` omitted)

### `ors`

Array consisting of policies (with `policyType` and `policyStaticProps` omitted)

### `metadata`

Key value pair used as data storage for a single `params`

Special fields within `metadata`. At the root of a policy, there needs to be a `metadata` object defined. It has to contain the following:

#### `startTime`

ISO datetime stamp of when to start policy

#### `endTime`

ISO datetime stamp of when to end policy

#### `chains`

Array of chain IDs to support. `number[]`</content>

  <title>FAQs - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/advanced/faq</url>
  <content>What chains does WalletConnect support?
---------------------------------------

WalletConnect operates as a chain-agnostic protocol, adhering to the [CAIP-25](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-25.md) standard. While the WalletConnect protocol supports various chains, you can refer to the [list](https://docs.reown.com/cloud/chains/chain-list) for the known compatible blockchains. However, please note that our SDKs have certain limitations on the chains they support.

If you intend to extend support for non-EVM chains in your wallet or dapp, it is recommended to review the cross-chain primitives supported by the WalletConnect protocol through the Chain Agnostic Standards Alliance’s [Namespaces](https://namespaces.chainagnostic.org/) project. Additionally, feel free to reach out to our community team for further guidance. In the event that the desired chain lacks documentation in the Namespaces project, you can collaborate with an expert in the respective chain’s tooling and submit a [namespaces PR](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/namespaces/?tab=readme-ov-file#namespaces).

Will the relay server `bridge.walletconnect.org` still work in v2?
------------------------------------------------------------------

No, the bridge servers are v1 only.

How can I reconnect to the same pairing if my browser was restarted?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The `signClient` will restore & reconnect its pairings automatically after the page is reloaded. All pairings are stored on the page’s `localStorage`.

For more context, feel free to check our [web examples](https://github.com/WalletConnect/web-examples).

The default relay endpoint is blocked. How can I get around this?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

When initializing `signClient`, you can set `relayUrl` to `wss://relay.walletconnect.org`.

How can we use a custom relay for our bridge without a WC URI parameter as the host?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are more than welcome to utilize a custom URI parameter during testing. However, it is currently not recommended for use in a production environment.

Why is self-hosting not an option at this time? Are there plans to make this possible in the future?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We understand the desire for developers to self-host their own relay. We share this vision, and have embarked on a decentralization roadmap in order to achieve this. By the end of this summer, we will launch a permissioned network and invite a select group of partners to participate in this crucial first phase. Our objective is to make self-hosting relay a reality with the creation of the decentralized WalletConnect Network, and we appreciate your patience as we progress in this enormous mission.

How do I report a security issue?

What’s New with the latest Reown AppKit
---------------------------------------

**Reown AppKit** is a powerful solution for developers looking to integrate wallet connections and other Web3 functionalities into their apps on any EVM chain. In just a few simple steps, you can provide your users with seamless wallet access, one-click authentication, social logins, and notifications—streamlining their experience while enabling advanced features like on-ramp functionality and smart accounts. By following this guide, you’ll quickly get up and running with Reown’s AppKit, enhancing your app’s user experience and interaction with blockchain technology.

Now here is the exciting part, the new features, so let’s dive in!

### AppKit is now multi-chain

Built from the ground up, AppKit has been reimagined to deliver an entirely new level of performance and flexibility. This isn’t just an upgrade, it’s a powerful transformation designed to supercharge your experience with enhanced speed, reliability, and seamless integrations. Onchain UX just got even better!

Appkit’s core architecture is now chain agnostic, allowing one instance to support multiple networks at once. Each network has it’s own adaptor which sits on top of the core SDK. Builders can simply create the required adaptors and and pass them in the `createAppkit()` function.

Currently, AppKit supports over 300 EVM chains and Solana, with more non-EVM chains coming soon [Learn more here](https://reown.com/blog/how-to-get-started-with-reown-appkit-on-any-evm-chain).

Universal Accounts
------------------

AppKit’s Universal Accounts are advanced, powerful smart accounts that are automatically set up for your users, unlocking seamless access to powerful features immediately.

### Key features

With Universal Accounts, users enjoy the benefits of gas abstraction through paymasters, allowing them to cover transaction fees with any ERC-20 token instead of being tied to native network tokens. This simplifies the user experience by eliminating the need for users to manage multiple tokens across different networks.

### Use cases and benefits

*   **Instant access**: Users can start interacting with your application immediately without worrying about funding their accounts with network-specific tokens.
*   **Streamlined transactions**: By using ERC-20 tokens for fees, transactions become more intuitive, reducing friction and enhancing overall engagement.
*   **Enhanced user onboarding**: New users can dive into your app without needing to navigate complex token management, making their first experience smooth and welcoming.

### Getting started

Setting up Universal Accounts is easy. Simply integrate with AppKit or upgrade your existing AppKit, and your users will automatically receive these smart accounts, enabling a powerful, user-friendly experience from day one.

Gas Abstraction, made simple
----------------------------

With AppKit, your users can enjoy a frictionless experience without the hassle of network fees. Reown gas abstraction feature leverages paymasters, dedicated modules that allow users to cover transaction fees with any ERC-20 token instead of native network tokens. This means no more managing tokens across networks just to interact with your app.

### Use cases and benefits

*   **Enhanced UX**: Remove barriers to entry by allowing users to transact without worrying about specific network gas tokens.
*   **Flexible payments**: Users can pay fees with popular ERC-20 tokens, making transactions more intuitive and accessible.
*   **Streamlined onboarding**: Create a seamless start for new users, who can interact with your app immediately, no token-swapping required.

### Get started in minutes

Integrating gas abstraction with AppKit is as easy as updating your AppKit SDK. With just a few lines of code, your app can support token paymasters, offering your users an optimized, fee-friendly experience from day one.

Create a Reown.id
-----------------

Forget long, confusing 0x addresses. With Reown IDs, your users can easily share their account details in a user-friendly format that enhances both security and convenience.

### How It works

Reown IDs act as unique identifiers for your users, allowing them to interact with dapps and wallets without the hassle of remembering complex addresses. This approach not only simplifies transactions but also reduces the risk of errors when sharing account information.

### Use cases and benefits

*   **Simplified sharing**: Users can easily provide their Reown ID to friends, services, or dapps, making it straightforward to engage in transactions or collaborations.
*   **Enhanced security**: By using Reown IDs instead of lengthy addresses, users reduce the chances of sharing incorrect information and falling victim to phishing attacks.
*   **Improved UX**: A clean and concise ID boosts user confidence, making it easier for new users to onboard into Web3.

### Getting started

Integrating Reown IDs into your application is seamless. Simply update your AppKit SDK, and your users will automatically receive their unique Reown IDs, making account sharing and interaction smoother than ever!”</content>

](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit-web-examples/tree/main/react/react-solana)

AppKit Minimal Installation
---------------------------

You can start a small project following the guidelines from our [installation React docs using Solana](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/core/installation?platform=solana)

Start building
--------------

In this guide, we are going to use the library [@solana/web3.js](https://solana.com/docs/clients/javascript-reference) to make the calls to the Solana blockchain and to interact with the wallet.

First, install the required dependency:

### Get Balance

Fetching a user’s balance is straightforward using the Connection object from Solana.

1.  Start by importing the `useAppKitConnection` hook from the solana Adapter, the `useAppKitAccount` AppKit hook to get the account information and `PublicKey` from the solana/web3 library.

2.  Use the hooks to retrieve the connection Solana object, the user’s address and check if they are connected.

3.  Create a function to fetch and display (in console) the balance when triggered

4.  Finally, in order to call the function you can show the button in a component when `isConnected` is `true`

### Sign a message

In order to raise the modal to sign a message with your wallet. You can follow these steps:

1.  Start by importing the `useAppKitProvider` hook.

2.  Extract the `walletProvider` function from the `useAppKitProvider` hook. This function allows you to prompt the connected wallet to sign a specific message. Also the `useAppKitAccount` AppKit hook to get the address and isConnected as explain before.

3.  Create a function to prompt the modal for signing the message.

4.  Finally, in order to call the function:

### Send a transaction in Solana

In order to raise the modal to sign and send a transaction with your wallet. It’s a bit more complex, but you can follow these steps:

1.  Start by importing very similar packages from the previous examples and also the Transaction and SystemProgram object from solana/web3.js library.

2.  Use the `useAppKitAccount`, useAppKitConnection and useAppKitProvider AppKit hooks to get the connection object, the walletProvider and the address from the user.

3.  Create the function to raise the modal to send the transaction

4.  Finally, in order to call the function:

Conclusion
----------

By following this guide, you’ve learned how to integrate Reown AppKit and Solana into your React application to perform essential wallet operations. You can now fetch wallet balances, sign messages, and send transactions in the Solana blockchain.

  <title>How to Build a Telegram Mini App with Reown AppKit? - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/recipes/telegram-mini-app</url>
  <content>Learn how to use Reown AppKit to enable wallet interactions on your Telegram mini app directly from your Telegram bot.

* * *

In this recipe, you will learn how to:

1.  Create a Telegram mini app and a Telegram bot.
2.  Configure your Telegram mini app with Reown AppKit.

This guide takes approximately 20 minutes to complete.

Let’s get started!

Setup
-----

In this section, you’ll learn how to set up a Telegram bot to host your Telegram mini-app, powered by Reown AppKit.

The first step is to create a Telegram bot. Let’s learn how we can do this.

### Create a Telegram Bot

Navigate to the [BotFather Telegram bot](https://t.me/BotFather). This bot will help you create, fully customize, and configure your new Telegram bot.

Type `/newbot` to start the creation process. You’ll be prompted to set a name for your bot—please enter your desired name. Next, you’ll be asked to set a unique username for the bot. Once you’ve completed these steps, your new Telegram bot will be ready to use!

Now, enter `/mybots` and it will show you a list of bots that you created. Select the bot you just created and click on “**Edit Bot**”. You will now be able to edit the bot’s info such as its description, picture, etc.

Now, go back to the bot menu and click on “**Bot Settings**”. Click on “**Configure Mini App**” and enter the URL you want to set for your mini app. In my case, I am setting it to [https://reown-appkit-evm.vercel.app/](https://reown-appkit-evm.vercel.app/).

Go back to the bot menu and click on “**Menu Button**”. You will now be able to set the URL that will be opened when a user clicks on the menu button. After this, you can also the title to be displayed on the button instead of ‘Menu’.

Your Telegram bot is now all set up! When a user opens the bot and clicks on “**Open App**” or “**Menu**,” the Telegram mini-app will open with the URL you configured.

Configure the Telegram Mini App with Reown AppKit
-------------------------------------------------

The URL I configured for my Telegram mini-app is [this](https://reown-appkit-evm.vercel.app/). As you can see, it’s a simple web app that allows users to connect their wallets and switch to any of the pre-configured networks available on the app.

If you’re using Reown AppKit to power wallet interactions on your Web3 app or Telegram mini-app, there’s nothing extra you need to do. Reown AppKit works with Telegram bots and mini-apps right out of the box. As long as you’re running the latest versions of Reown AppKit, no further setup is required.

If you’d like to learn how to integrate Reown AppKit, please refer to the in-depth guide linked below:

[How to Get Started with Reown AppKit on Any EVM Chain](https://reown.com/blog/how-to-get-started-with-reown-appkit-on-any-evm-chain)

You can also check out the GitHub repository below, which powers the URL configured for my Telegram mini-app:

[

AppKit EVM Example
------------------

Check out the complete AppKit example on this Github repo.



](https://github.com/rohit-710/reown-appkit-evm)

Run your Telegram Mini App
--------------------------

Now, open your Telegram bot and click “**Start**.” The bot will open your mini-app within Telegram. As you can see, the mini-app opened by my Telegram bot is the Web3 app configured with Reown AppKit. You’ll notice a “**Connect Wallet**” button, which allows you to connect your Web3 wallet to the mini-app.

When you click “**Connect Wallet**”, the AppKit modal will open, prompting you to choose your preferred connection method. You’ll also notice that the mini-app supports social login, which could be a game changer for onboarding a large number of users to various mini-apps.

After you select your preferred wallet and connect it, you should be able to see that your wallet was successfully connected to the mini app.

Conclusion
----------

And that’s it! You have now learned how to create a simple Telegram bot and configure it with your Telegram mini app using Reown AppKit.

  <title>Travel Rule using AppKit - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/recipes/travel-rule</url>
  <content>What is the Travel Rule?
------------------------

The Travel Rule is a regulatory requirement designed to enhance transparency in financial transactions by mandating the exchange of specific information about both senders and recipients. Initially applied to traditional wire transfers, this rule has been extended to the cryptocurrency sector, especially affecting Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) under guidelines set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).

Travel Rule in Cryptocurrency
-----------------------------

In 2019, and updated in 2021, the FATF established standards for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) to follow similar protocols as traditional financial institutions. For crypto transactions, the suggested threshold is approximately EUR 1K.

### Authentication Scenario

SIWX (Sign In With Solana, EVM or Bitcoin) is a two-step authentication process:

1.  **Connect Wallet**: First, the user connects their self-custodial wallet.
    
2.  **Sign Message**: After connecting, the user signs a message with their wallet to prove ownership of the account. This signature cryptographically proves that they control the private keys.
    

Here’s a practical example:

*   John wants to transfer funds from his PortugalEx account to his non-custodial wallet
*   PortugalEx implements AppKit in their withdrawal page to enable wallet connections
*   When John initiates the withdrawal:
    1.  He connects his self-custodial wallet through AppKit’s interface
    2.  AppKit prompts him to sign a message with the connected wallet

  <title>Gas Sponsorship with Reown - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/recipes/sponsoring-first-transaction</url>
  <content>In this recipe, you will learn how to:

*   Create a Paymaster Policy on Cloud
*   Use the policy in your dApp to sponsor transactions
*   Sponsor using Appkit’s embedded account

This guide takes approximately 20 minutes to complete and is split into 2 parts. First, we will be using pre-made policies that interact with smart accounts deployed in service of [Appkit lab](https://appkit-lab.reown.com/library/wagmi/) and validated there. The second half involves integrating it into your own dApp.

Let’s dive in!

Prerequisites
-------------

*   A fundamental understanding of JavaScript and React.
*   Obtain a new project Id on Reown Cloud at [https://cloud.reown.com](https://cloud.reown.com/)
*   Since Gas Sponsorship is an early access feature, your projectId needs to be access listed. Please [contact us](https://reown.com/contact).

Part 1: Steps to Set up a policy
--------------------------------

1.  Open the Cloud dashboard and click on “Paymaster” in the sidebar.
2.  Click “Add Policy”. When prompted, choose “Testnet” chains for testing.
3.  Enter your Policy name and click next.
4.  On the chain selection screen, simply click next since all testnet chains are enabled.
5.  You’ll then see the Control Sponsorships screen.
6.  For most cases, the no-code builder works well, though there is a [detailed guide for custom policies](https://docs.reown.com/cloud/paymaster) if needed.

**Required Items:**

1.  Input the contract address
2.  The ABI of the contract
3.  Select the method you’ve chosen to sponsor
4.  _IMPORTANT_: If you would like to sponsor the deployment of smart accounts on your app, tick the `Sponsor Smart Account Deployment` checkbox.
5.  Click “Create”.

You now have a functional policy!

Retrieving the Paymaster URL
----------------------------

Each Paymaster is linked to a specific chain. Click the “RPC URLs” button to view all supported chain URLs.

Select `Sepolia` and copy the URL provided to get your paymaster URL.

Testing the Paymaster Out
-------------------------

Before integrating this functionality into your dApp, you can test that you set up the policy by visiting [Appkit Lab](https://appkit-lab.reown.com/library/wagmi/).

Login with Appkit Email or Social Login (Google, Apple, etc)

Scroll down to “Send Calls with custom abi (Paymaster Service)” and

1.  Input your smart contract address
2.  Paste the ABI of the contract
3.  Select the method you’ve chosen to sponsor
4.  Add any method arguments in the format of an array
5.  Add any value if necessary
6.  Paste your Paymaster URL
7.  Hit send calls.

You can check it in two simple ways:

*   In your browser’s network tab, filter for sendUserOperation. If the payload includes paymasterAndData, it’s working.
*   Alternatively, copy the send call result, paste it into “Get Call Status”, then use the transaction receipt on Sepolia Etherscan. It will show the paymaster covering the gas.

Part 2: Integrating with your dApp
----------------------------------

After setting up your policy, you can seamlessly add blockchain call functionality to your dApp using Wagmi’s `useSendCalls` hook. This hook simplifies interacting with the blockchain, allowing you to trigger transactions directly from your React component.

### Define the ABI

### Calculate CallData and Prepare the transaction

### Import `sendCalls` from Wagmi

### Add Event Handler to a button

For more information on sponsoring calls, read more in [our docs](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/features/sponsored-transactions).

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you’re running into issues getting a transaction to be successfully sponsored, it’s best to isolate issues. So to get started, first:

### Setup Environment

1.  Use AppKit’s Embedded Smart Wallet: Login using social login (Ex. Gmail) or your email
    
2.  Ensure the code performs send calls as simply as possible., eg: hardcode the `capabilities` object and remove any extra conditional logic.
    
3.  Keep the network tab on your browser console open
    

### Ensure a call to the paymaster is being made

Since the embedded wallet lives on your browser, you can observe the network calls it makes.

If, after performing the `sendCalls` and approving it in the AppKit Embedded Wallet, there is no call to the paymaster URL provided, it likely means that the `capabilities` were not filled in properly.

Ensure the capabilities object you’re sending looks like this:

### Paymaster was called but returned an error

#### Simulation Errors

The most common errors encountered with integrating Paymasters typically come in the form of simulation errors.

Thankfully, the paymaster provides a full report of user ops that run into errors. For example:

#### No calls were made to the specified contract.

1.  Ensure that the chain ID provided in the paymaster URL matches the network you are on
    
2.  Ensure you are targeting the contract and method specified in your policy
    

### Not sure if everything’s set up correctly?

1.  Confirm a call to the Paymaster is being made via the network tab
2.  Ensure the response from the call is not `0x` or an `error`.
3.  Verify the call to the `bundler` (also viewed in the network tab) that is performing `sendUserOperation` has filled the `paymasterData` field
4.  Grab the user op hash (result from `sendUserOperation`) and paste it into a block explorer that supports searching by User Op Hashes like BlockScout
5.  Ensure the paymaster sponsor field is filled

  <title>Sponsored Transactions - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/features/sponsored-transactions</url>
  <content>Sponsored transactions is an umbrella term for multiple methods of utilizing [ERC 7677](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7677) paymasters that allow a dapp to cover the gas fees for the transaction of a wallet.

This approach simplifies blockchain interactions by enabling users to perform actions without directly handling transaction fees, which are instead paid by the dApp. This concept is particularly beneficial for attracting new users, as it removes the need to understand complex wallet mechanics or hold cryptocurrency for gas fees, making the overall experience more intuitive and accessible.

](https://appkit-lab.reown.com/)

### Deployment

Smart Accounts are deployed alongside the first transaction. Until deployment, a precalculated address, known as the counterfactual address, is displayed. Despite not being deployed, the account can still sign using 6492 signatures.

### Supported Networks

**Smart Accounts are available on several EVM networks. You can view the complete list of supported networks [here](https://docs.pimlico.io/infra/platform/supported-chains).**

### User Eligibility

Smart Accounts are exclusively available for embedded wallet users (email and social login)

FAQ
---

### What is a Smart Account?

A Smart Account improves the traditional account experience by replacing Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) with a Smart Contract that follows the [ERC-4337 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337). This opens up many use cases that were previously unavailable.

Smart Accounts do no require Private Keys or Seed Phrases, instead they rely on a key or multiple keys from designated signers to access the smart account and perform actions on chain. The keys can take multiple forms including passkeys and EOA signatures.

### What can I do with a Smart Account?

Smart accounts unlock a host of use cases that were previously unavailable with EOAs. Essentially anything that can be programmed into a smart contract can be used by Smart Accounts.

*   **Automated Transactions:** Set up recurring payments or conditional transfers.
*   **Multi-Signature Authorization:** Require multiple approvals for a transaction to increase security.
*   **Delegated Transactions:** Allow a third party to execute transactions on your behalf under specific conditions.
*   **Enhanced Security:** Implement complex security mechanisms such as time-locked transactions and withdrawal limits.
*   **Interoperability:** Interact seamlessly with decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.
*   **Custom Logic:** Create custom transaction rules and workflows that align with personal or business requirements.

### How do I get a Smart Account?

Existing AppKit Universal Wallet Users will be given the option to upgrade their account to a smart account. Once you upgrade you will still be able to access your EOA and self-custody your account.

New AppKit Universal Wallet Users will be given smart accounts by default when they login for the first time.

### Does it cost anything?

There is a small additional cost for activating your smart account. The activation fee is added to the first transaction and covers the network fees required for deploying the new smart contract onchain.

### Can I export my Smart Account?

No, you cannot export your Smart Account. The Smart Account (SA) is deployed by the EOA and is owned by the EOA. Your EOA account will always be exportable. Also is good to know that SA don’t have seedphrases.

### Can I withdraw all my funds from my Smart Account?

Yes, you can withdraw all your funds from your Smart Account.

### What are account names?

Smart account addresses start with ’0x’ followed by 42 characters, this is the unique address of your smart account on the network. ‘0x’ addresses like this are long, unwieldy and unmemorable. AppKit allows you to assign a more memorable name for your smart account using [ENS Resolvers](https://docs.ens.domains/resolvers/ccip-read).

You can assign a name to your account and this will act as an alias for your account that can be shared publicly and provide a better user experience. AppKit account names are followed by the “reown.id” domain.

### What can I do with my account name?

As AppKit smart account addresses are the same across the supported networks by [Pimlico](https://docs.pimlico.io/infra/platform/supported-chains), you only need one account name which can then be used across the networks.

For example if you want someone to send you USDC on Polygon they can send it to “johnsmith.reown.id”. If you want someone wants to send you USDC on Optimism they can also use “johnsmith.reown.id”.</content>

  <title>Bitcoin - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/networks/bitcoin</url>
  <content>The AppKit SDK supports Bitcoin, allowing users to connect their Bitcoin wallets to applications. AppKit provides a simple, secure, and seamless in-app experience for users looking to transact within web3.

### Bitcoin Standards and Supported Wallets

The AppKit Bitcoin integration aims to support connections through WBIPs and the Bitcoin Wallet Standard. However, most wallets have their own proprietary connection interfaces. To address this, we will gradually expand the list of supported wallets.

Currently, the following extension wallets are supported:

*   **Xverse**
*   **OKX**
*   **Leather**
*   **Phantom**.

While we provide a standardized interface for Bitcoin connector methods, not all wallets support every method. As a result, you may encounter a `MethodNotSupportedError` when attempting to use methods that are not supported by a specific wallet. If your wallet supports a mentioned standard but you cannot connect, please reach out to our development team for assistance via [Github issues](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/issues/new/choose).

  <title>Authentication (SIWX) - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/authentication/siwx/default</url>
  <content>Introduction
------------

The **Sign In With X** feature enables decentralized applications (Dapps) to authenticate users seamlessly across multiple blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, Polygon or Solana. This feature allows developers using our SDK to implement authentication by having users sign a unique string message with their blockchain wallets. The **Sign In With X** feature is designed in accordance with the [CAIP-122](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/main/CAIPs/caip-122.md) standard, which establishes a chain-agnostic framework for blockchain-based authentication and authorization on off-chain services.

[

Try Demo
--------



](https://appkit-lab.reown.com/library/siwx-default/)

Getting Started
---------------

**SIWX** works as a plugin system for AppKit and you are going to add the plugin in the AppKit configuration. There are some ways to implement the **SIWX** feature:

*   Use the default implementation provided by AppKit
*   Use Cloud Auth SIWX to manage the sessions in the Cloud Dashboard
*   Create a custom implementation to suit your specific requirements.

To initialize the **SIWX** feature, you need to add the `siwx` parameter to the `createAppKit` function.

### Default Implementation

By using the default implementation, you can quickly integrate the **SIWX** feature into your Dapp. The default implementation provides a set of pre-built components that allow you to have the feature up and running in no time.

Read more about the [Default Implementation](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/authentication/siwx/siwx-default).

### Cloud Auth Implementation

The Cloud Auth SIWX is a predefined implementation of the SIWX configuration plugin that uses the Cloud service to create and manage SIWX messages and sessions. With Cloud Auth SIWX, you will be able to see and control the sessions of your users using the [User Management Dashboard](https://docs.reown.com/cloud/user-management).

Read more about the [Cloud Auth Implementation](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/authentication/siwx/siwx-cloud-auth).

### Custom Implementation

The `siwx` param expects to receive a defined interface from which you are able to create your own implementation. This is what allows you to customize the feature to suit your specific requirements.

The defined interface must follow specific rules to make sure that AppKit can interact with it correctly. Read more about how to have your [Custom Implementation](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/authentication/siwx/siwx-custom).

SIWX Expected Behavior
----------------------

*   **SIWX** will prompt to get the user signature and verify his identity every time a connection happen;
*   In case a SIWX session is already stored, the user will be automatically signed in and the prompt step will be skipped;
*   If the user changes the connected network, **SIWX** will prompt to get the user signature and verify his identity again;
*   If the user disconnects from the Dapp, **SIWX** will revoke the session and the user will need to sign in again.

Migrating from SIWE to SIWX
---------------------------

If you are currently already using **SIWE** from `@reown/appkit-siwe`, after AppKit version 1.5.0, you will be migrated into **SIWX**. The migration process is automatic and your `siweConfig` from `createAppKit` function will be mapped internally.</content>

  <title>How to Interact with EVM Smart Contracts using AppKit and React - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/recipes/EVM-smart-contract-interaction</url>
  <content>In this recipe, you will learn how to:

*   Read data from a smart contract
*   Write data to a smart contract

This guide takes approximately 20 minutes to complete.

Let’s dive in!

Prerequisites
-------------

*   A fundamental understanding of JavaScript and React.
*   A minimal installation of AppKit in React.
*   Obtain a new project Id on Reown Cloud at [https://cloud.reown.com](https://cloud.reown.com/)

Final project

-------------------------------

*   [Ethers Example](https://appkit-web-examples-react-ethers.reown.com/)
*   [Wagmi Example](https://appkit-web-examples-react-wagmi.reown.com/)

Requirements
------------

In order to interact with a smart contract you will need to have one deployed in a EVM-compatible blockchain. There are several tools to help you deploy a smart contract:

*   [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
*   [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)
*   [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/)
*   [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)

We have already deployed a simple smart contract (0xEe6D291CC60d7CeD6627fA4cd8506912245c8cA4) in Sepolia Testnet for you to use. Once you compile the smart contract, you get the ABI. The ABI is a set of rules that define how the contract’s functions can be called and how data is sent and received.

To interact with the smart contract, you need to have some tokens to pay for gas fees when writing to the contract. You can get them from this [faucet](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia), but you can also look for other options on the web. It’s also good to know that reading from a smart contract is free.

For both SDKs, you need to declare the contract address and ABI.

### Start building with Wagmi

1.  Start by importing the hooks to read and write.

  <title>How to Configure AppKit with Virtual TestNets? - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/recipes/tenderly-virtual-testnets</url>
  <content>Learn how to use Reown AppKit to enable wallet connections and interact with [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/) Virtual Testnets. With AppKit, you can provide seamless wallet connections, including email and social logins, on-ramp functionality, smart accounts, one-click authentication, and wallet notifications, all designed to deliver an exceptional user experience. With Tenderly’s Virtual TestNets, you can replicate real networks for various stages of your Web3 app development.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

1.  Set up Reown AppKit.
2.  Configure a wallet connection modal and enable interactions with Tenderly’s Virtual TestNets.

This guide takes approximately 20 minutes to complete.

Let’s get started!

Setup
-----

In this section, you’ll learn how to set up the development environment to use AppKit with Tenderly’s Virtual TestNets.

For this tutorial, we’ll be using Next.js, though you can use any other framework compatible with AppKit.

> AppKit is available on eight frameworks, including React, Next.js, Vue, JavaScript, React Native, Flutter, Android, iOS, and Unity.

Now, let’s create a Next app. In order to do so, please run the command given below:

The above command creates a Next app and sets the name of the Next app as “appkit-vTestnet-example”.

### Install AppKit

Now, we need to install AppKit and other dependencies that we need for our app to function as expected. For this tutorial, we will be using “wagmi” as our preferred Ethereum library. However, you can also use [Ethers](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/next/core/installation?platform=ethers).

> You can also use other package managers such as `yarn`, `bun`, `pnpm`, etc.

### Create a new project on Reown Cloud

Now, we need to get a project Id from Reown Cloud that we will use to set up AppKit with Wagmi config. Navigate to [cloud.reown.com](https://cloud.reown.com/) and sign in. If you have not created an account yet, please do so before we proceed.

After you have logged in, please navigate to the “**Projects**” section of the Cloud and click on “**Create Project**”.

Now, enter the name for your project and click on “**Continue**”.

Select the product as “**AppKit**” and click on “**Continue**”.

Select the framework as “**Next.js**” and click on “**Create**”. Reown Cloud will now create a new project for you which will also generate a project Id.

You will notice that your project was successfully created. On the top left corner, you will be able to find your Project Id. Please copy that as you will need that later.

### Create a Virtual TestNet using Tenderly

Navigate to [Tenderly Dashboard](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/explorer) and login. If you don’t have an account already, then please sign up.

Now, navigate to “**Virtual TestNets**” on the dashboard.

Click on **“Create Virtual TestNet.”** Next, you’ll be prompted to select the parent network. For simplicity, select **“Sepolia”** as the parent network, though you can choose any network you prefer.

Now, enter a name for your Virtual TestNet. Under **“Chain ID,”** select **“Custom”** and enter a unique chain ID, like **“73571,”** to avoid conflicts with the existing Sepolia chain. Set **“Public Explorer”** to **“On”** and **“Smart Contract Visibility”** to **“Full.”**

Now, click on **“Create”** to set up the Virtual TestNet. You will see that your Virtual TestNet has been created, and you can find the RPC and other relevant information for it. Please copy the `HTTPS` URL under “**Public**” as this will be your Virtual TestNet’s RPC URL.

Build the App
-------------

Before we build the app, let’s first configure our `.env` file. On the root level of your code directory, create a new file named `.env`.

Open that file and create a new variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID`. You will assign the project Id that you copied in the previous step to this environment variable that you just created. You need to do the same for `TENDERLY_VIRTUAL_TESTNET_RPC`. This is what it will look like:

### Configure AppKit

We’ve created an in-depth technical guide on getting started with Reown AppKit on any EVM chain. Refer to the guide below to learn how to configure AppKit. A GitHub repository is also provided at the end of the guide, which you can clone to quickly get started.

[How to Get Started with Reown AppKit on Any EVM Chain](https://reown.com/blog/how-to-get-started-with-reown-appkit-on-any-evm-chain)

### Configure Tenderly Virtual TestNet with AppKit

In order to set up Tenderly’s Virtual TestNet with AppKit, you need to first configure your Tenderly Virtual TestNet as a custom chain.

Inside your `/app` directory, create a new file named `tenderly.config.ts`. Now, paste the code snippet shared below inside the code file, i.e., `app/tenderly.config.ts`.

1.  `id` - set this to the chain Id that you passed while creating the Virtual TestNet on Tenderly.
2.  `url` - set this with your your Virtual TestNet’s explorer URL. You can find this URL within your Virtual TestNet’s configuration on Tenderly Dashboard.

Now, in your `config/index.tsx` file, import `vTestnet` from `app/tenderly.config.ts`. You’ll also need to configure transports within the `WagmiAdapter` function. Refer to the code snippet below.

Now, inside your `context/index.tsx` file, you also need to import `vTestnet` and pass it as one of the supported networks within the `createAppKit` function, as shown below.

You can now run the app and test it out. In order to do so, run the command given below.

> If you are using alternative package managers, you can try either of these commands - `yarn dev`, or `pnpm dev`, or `bun dev`.

Conclusion
----------

And that’s it! You have now learned how to create a simple app using AppKit and configure it with [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/) Virtual TestNets.

AppKit Minimal Installation
---------------------------

You can start a small project following the guidelines from our [installation React docs using Ethers](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/core/installation?platform=ethers)

Start building
--------------

In this guide we are going to use the library [Ethers](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/) to make calls to the blockchain and to interact with the wallet.

To get the balance, sign a message and send a transaction follow the same steps in each operation:

1.  Start by importing the BrowserProvider object, some AppKit hooks to get the account information, chain id and the Provider.

2.  Use the `useAppKitAccount` hook to retrieve the user’s address and check if they are connected. The `useAppKitNetworkCore` hook to get the chain id and the `useAppKitProvider` hook to get the wallet provider.

### Get Balance

Fetching a user’s balance is straightforward using the `BrowserProvider` object from ethers.

3.  Create a function to fetch and display (in console) the balance when triggered

4.  Finally, to call the function you can show the button in a component when `isConnected` is `true`

### Sign a message

To raise the modal to sign a message with your wallet. You can follow with these steps:

3.  Generate the function to raise the modal to sign the message

4.  Finally, to call the function:

### Send a transaction in EVM

In order to raise the modal to sign and send a transaction with your wallet. You can follow with these steps:

3.  Create the test transaction

4.  Generate the function to raise the modal to send the transaction

4.  Finally, to invoke the function:

Conclusion
----------

By following this guide, you’ve learned how to integrate Reown AppKit and Ethers in your React application to perform essential wallet operations. You can now fetch wallet balances, sign messages, and send transactions seamlessly in an EVM-compatible blockchain environment.

  <title>Installation - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/vue/core/installation</url>
  <content>Vue
---

Introduction
------------

AppKit has support for [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) and [Ethers v6](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/) on Ethereum, [@solana/web3.js](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/) on Solana and Bitcoin. Choose one of these to get started.

### AppKit CLI

Reown offers a dedicated CLI to set up a minimal version of AppKit in the easiest and quickest way possible.

To do this, please run the command below.

After running the command, you will be prompted to confirm the installation of the CLI. Upon your confirmation, the CLI will request the following details:

1.  **Project Name**: Enter the name for your project.
2.  **Framework**: Select your preferred framework or library. Currently, you have three options: React, Next.js, and Vue.
3.  **Network-Specific libraries**: Choose whether you want to install Wagmi, Ethers, Solana, or Multichain (EVM + Solana).

After providing the project name and selecting your preferences, the CLI will install a minimal example of AppKit with your preferred blockchain library. The example will be pre-configured with a `projectId` that will only work on `localhost`.

To fully configure your project, please obtain a `projectId` from the Reown Cloud Dashboard and update your project accordingly.

**Refer to [this section](https://docs.reown.com/_sites/docs.reown.com/appkit/vue/core/installation#cloud-configuration) for more information.**

### Custom Installation

Cloud Configuration
-------------------

Create a new project on Reown Cloud at [https://cloud.reown.com](https://cloud.reown.com/) and obtain a new project ID.

Implementation
--------------

[

wagmi Example
-------------

Check the Vue wagmi example



](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit-web-examples/tree/main/vue/vue-wagmi)

For a quick integration, you can use the `createAppKit` function with a unified configuration. This automatically applies the predefined configurations for different adapters like Wagmi, Ethers, or Solana, so you no longer need to manually configure each one individually. Simply pass the common parameters such as `projectId`, `chains`, `metadata`, etc., and the function will handle the adapter-specific configurations under the hood.

This includes WalletConnect, Coinbase and Injected connectors, and the [Blockchain API](https://docs.reown.com/cloud/blockchain-api) as a [transport](https://wagmi.sh/core/api/createConfig#transports)

In your `App.vue` file set up the following configuration

Importing networks
------------------

Reown AppKit use [Viem](https://viem.sh/) networks under the hood, which provide a wide variety of networks for EVM chains. You can find all the networks supported by Viem within the `@reown/appkit/networks` path.

Trigger the modal
-----------------

To open AppKit you can use our [**web component**](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/core/components) or build your own button with AppKit [**composables**](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/core/composables.mdx#useAppKit). In this example we are going to use the `<appkit-button>` component.

Web components are global html elements that don’t require importing.

Learn more about the AppKit web components [here](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/core/components)

Smart Contract Interaction
--------------------------

[Wagmi actions](https://wagmi.sh/core/api/actions/readContract) can help us interact with wallets and smart contracts:

  <title>Switching to Send Calls - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/recipes/switching-to-send-calls</url>
  <content>With Smart Account wallets on the rise, new standards are being adopted by Dapps and Wallets that take advantage of their capabilities. One of these standards is [EIP 5792](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5792). In short, it introduces a few methods that smart accounts would support, that enable a couple of cool features including:

1.  **Batched Transactions**: This allows to batch multiple transactions into a single one that will be executed.
2.  **Using Paymasters**: EIP 5792 has a concept of `capabilities` which determine what a wallet can do and also what a dapp wants a wallet to do. This allows the use of Paymasters, which are defined in [ERC 7677](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7677).

### A note on Smart Accounts and EOAs

Not all users will be using Smart Accounts; Some will be using EOAs (Externally Owned Accounts). These wallets do not support EIP 5792 and will be incompatible with `sendCalls`.

This means that before using `sendCalls`, there needs to be a check on whether the account is compatible or not. Thankfully, this can be achieved using `getCapabilities`.

An example custom hook that leverages Wagmi’s hooks for `getCapabilities` can be found [in our lab](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/blob/main/apps/laboratory/src/hooks/useWagmiActiveCapabilities.ts#L22). This hook is then used also [in our lab](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/blob/main/apps/laboratory/src/components/Wagmi/WagmiSendCallsTest.tsx#L40). Essentially - the Wallet will inform the Dapp if it supports EIP 5792 or not. Regardless of whether `wagmi` or `ethers` is used, once capabilities are fetched, you can then check:

Or disable the button entirely like in the example above, depending on the intent. This handling does not need to be replicated for all calls within a Dapp, but instead only for the calls where 5792 needs to leveraged. For example, if there is an existing transaction within a Dapp that should be modified to allow sponsoring gas.

### Sending transactions

For Dapps that are using `writeContractAsync`, switching to `sendCalls` involves a minor change in encoding the call. An example of it in use can be found [here](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/blob/main/apps/laboratory/src/components/Wagmi/WagmiSendCallsWithPaymasterServiceTest.tsx#L137). Important to note is that the function call data is pre-encoded [on line 12](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/blob/main/apps/laboratory/src/components/Wagmi/WagmiSendCallsWithPaymasterServiceTest.tsx#L12) within the same file. This is the main difference as `writeContractAsync` encodes the calls itself.

### Getting Receipts or Call Status

Typically, alongside `writeContractAsync` or similar calls, there would be a `waitForTransactionReceipt` used to wait for the transaction. Sending calls via the EIP 5792 standards by design does not return a transaction hash by design.

Instead, `sendCalls` will return an identifier for the transaction which can be queried via getting the calls’ status. In Wagmi’s case, this is done using [`useCallsStatus`](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useCallsStatus#usecallsstatus).

An example can be found [in our lab](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/blob/main/apps/laboratory/src/components/Wagmi/WagmiGetCallsStatusTest.tsx#L52).</content>

  <title>Flutter - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/flutter/core/installation</url>
  <content>With AppKit Flutter, you can easily let people interact with multiple EVM compatible wallets and blockchains.

Let’s get started with the installation and configuration!

Installation
------------

1.  *   Add `reown_appkit` as dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` and run `flutter pub get` (check out the [latest version](https://pub.dev/packages/reown_appkit/install))
    *   Or simply run `flutter pub add reown_appkit`
2.  *   Locate your `/ios/Podfile` file and add the following as the first line:

3.  *   Run `$ pod install` inside `/ios` folder.
4.  *   You should now be able to run your app with `flutter run --dart-define=PROJECT_ID={your_project_id}`

### Enable Installed Wallet Detection

To enable AppKit to detect installed wallets on the device, you need to make specific changes to the native sides of the project.

1.  Open your `Info.plist` file.
2.  Locate the `<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>` section.
3.  Add the desired wallet schemes as string entries within the `<array>`. These schemes represent the wallets you want to detect.
4.  Refer to our [Info.plist example file](https://github.com/reown-com/reown_flutter/blob/master/packages/reown_appkit/example/modal/ios/Runner/Info.plist) for a detailed illustration.

Example:

### Coinbase Wallet support

Coinbase Wallet does not use the WalletConnect protocol for communication between the dApp and the wallet.

This means that pairing topic, session topic, session events and other session-related features are not available when connecting to Coinbase Wallet.

However, you can still enable it to seamlessly connect with your dApp with these additional steps.

If you still want to support it, on your iOS and Android native side make the following changes:

1.  Open your `Info.plist` file.
2.  Locate the `<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>` section.
3.  Include `<string>cbwallet</string>` scheme as mentioned above in previous section

Example:

4.  Make sure pods are installed, otherwise run `pod install` inside your `/ios` folder.
5.  Open your `/ios/Runner.xcworkspace` file with Xcode and add the following code in `AppDelegate.swift` file:

Checkout out the [AppDelegate.swift](https://github.com/reown-com/reown_flutter/blob/master/packages/reown_appkit/example/modal/ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift) file from our sample dapp for reference.

#### Disable Coinbase Wallet

Coinbase Wallet is enabled by default even if, in order to function properly, a few steps has to be done as described in the previous section. However, if you don’t want to include/support Coinbase Wallet on your app you just need to pass Coinbase Wallet id `fd20dc426fb37566d803205b19bbc1d4096b248ac04548e3cfb6b3a38bd033aa` to [excludedWalletIds](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/flutter/core/options#excludedwalletids) options Array.

### Phantom Wallet support

Phantom Wallet does not use the WalletConnect protocol for communication between the dApp and the wallet, instead it provides an internal API mechanism based on deep/universal links.

This means that pairing topic, session topic, session events and other session-related features are not available when connecting to Phantom Wallet and the interaction is really basic. Dapp sends a request, Phantom Wallet responds. That’s all.

Furthermore, Phantom Wallet’s deep/universal linking mechanism supports interaction exclusively with the Solana network. This means that if you have EVM networks configured in your AppKit instance, they will not be available for use after connecting with Phantom.

In order to support Phantom Wallet interactions a few extra steps has to be performed (only if you haven’t implemented [Link Mode](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/flutter/core/link-mode) already).

1.  First, be sure you already have your redirection back property configure in your dApp’s metadata. See [Redirect to your dApp](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/flutter/core/usage#redirect-to-your-dapp)
2.  Then you will have to implement your own Deep Link mechanism on Flutter (and native) side so when a link is received through it, you would just call `await _appKitModal.dispatchEnvelope(link);`

As a guidance, here you can see how it’s done in our sample dApp:

##### First, on Flutter side we create an `EventChannel` where links are going to be received and passed to `dispatchEnvelope()`.

##### Then, on both native sides we leverage native APIs to capture the app opening link and send it to Flutter side.

*   [Android’s platform specific code](https://github.com/reown-com/reown_flutter/blob/develop/packages/reown_appkit/example/base/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/example/dapp/MainActivity.kt) (only `eventsChannel` is important Phantom wise)
*   [iOS’s platform specific code](https://github.com/reown-com/reown_flutter/blob/develop/packages/reown_appkit/example/base/ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift) (only `eventsChannel` is important Phantom wise)
*   [Dart’s specific code](https://github.com/reown-com/reown_flutter/blob/develop/packages/reown_appkit/example/base/lib/utils/deep_link_handler.dart) (only `eventsChannel` is important Phantom wise)

_Constructing a Solana transaction would depend on the library/package of your choice but in [_our sample dApp’s code_](https://github.com/reown-com/reown_flutter/blob/develop/packages/reown_appkit/example/base/lib/utils/crypto/helpers.dart#L170) you can see how we do it using `solana_web3` package._

#### Disable Phantom Wallet

Phantom Wallet is enabled by default even if, in order to function properly, a few steps has to be done as described in the previous section. However, if you don’t want to include/support Phantom Wallet on your app you just need to pass Phantom Wallet id `a797aa35c0fadbfc1a53e7f675162ed5226968b44a19ee3d24385c64d1d3c393` to [excludedWalletIds](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/flutter/core/options#excludedwalletids) options Array.

### AppKit CLI

Reown offers a dedicated CLI to set up a minimal version of AppKit in the easiest and quickest way possible.

To do this, please run the command below.

After running the command, you will be prompted to confirm the installation of the CLI. Upon your confirmation, the CLI will request the following details:

1.  **Project Name**: Enter the name for your project.
2.  **Framework**: Select your preferred framework or library. Currently, you have three options: React, Next.js, and Vue.
3.  **Network-Specific libraries**: Choose whether you want to install Wagmi, Ethers, Solana, or Multichain (EVM + Solana).

After providing the project name and selecting your preferences, the CLI will install a minimal example of AppKit with your preferred blockchain library. The example will be pre-configured with a `projectId` that will only work on `localhost`.

To fully configure your project, please obtain a `projectId` from the Reown Cloud Dashboard and update your project accordingly.

**Refer to [this section](https://docs.reown.com/_sites/docs.reown.com/appkit/react/core/installation#cloud-configuration) for more information.**

### Custom Installation

Cloud Configuration
-------------------

Create a new project on reown Cloud at [https://cloud.reown.com](https://cloud.reown.com/) and obtain a new project ID.

Implementation
--------------

[

wagmi Example
-------------

Check the React wagmi example



](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit-web-examples/tree/main/react/react-wagmi)

For a quick integration, you can use the `createAppKit` function with a unified configuration. This automatically applies the predefined configurations for different adapters like Wagmi, Ethers, or Solana, so you no longer need to manually configure each one individually. Simply pass the common parameters such as `projectId`, `chains`, `metadata`, etc., and the function will handle the adapter-specific configurations under the hood.

This includes WalletConnect, Coinbase and Injected connectors, and the [Blockchain API](https://docs.reown.com/cloud/blockchain-api) as a [transport](https://wagmi.sh/core/api/createConfig#transports)

On top of your app set up the following configuration, making sure that all functions are called **outside** any React component to avoid unwanted rerenders.

Importing networks
------------------

Reown AppKit use [Viem](https://viem.sh/) networks under the hood, which provide a wide variety of networks for EVM chains. You can find all the networks supported by Viem within the `@reown/appkit/networks` path.

Trigger the modal
-----------------

To open AppKit you can use our [**web component**](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/core/components) or build your own button with AppKit [**hooks**](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/core/hooks.mdx#useAppKit). In this example we are going to use the `<appkit-button>` component.

### Custom Installation

Cloud Configuration
-------------------

Create a new project on Reown Cloud at [https://cloud.reown.com](https://cloud.reown.com/) and obtain a new project ID.

Implementation
--------------

[

wagmi Example
-------------

Check the Next wagmi example



](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit-web-examples/tree/main/nextjs/next-wagmi-app-router)

For a quick integration, you can use the `createAppKit` function with a unified configuration. This automatically applies the predefined configurations for different adapters like Wagmi, Ethers, or Solana, so you no longer need to manually configure each one individually. Simply pass the common parameters such as projectId, chains, metadata, etc., and the function will handle the adapter-specific configurations under the hood.

This includes WalletConnect, Coinbase and Injected connectors, and the [Blockchain API](https://docs.reown.com/cloud/blockchain-api) as a [transport](https://wagmi.sh/core/api/createConfig#transports)

### Wagmi config

Create a new file for your Wagmi configuration, since we are going to be calling this function on the client and the server it cannot live inside a file with the ‘use client’ directive.

For this example we will create a file called `config/index.tsx` outside our app directory and set up the following configuration

Importing networks
------------------

Reown AppKit use [Viem](https://viem.sh/) networks under the hood, which provide a wide variety of networks for EVM chains. You can find all the networks supported by Viem within the `@reown/appkit/networks` path.

SSR and Hydration
-----------------

:::info

*   Using cookies is completely optional and by default Wagmi will use `localStorage` instead if the `storage` param is not defined.
*   The `ssr` flag will delay the hydration of the Wagmi’s store to avoid hydration mismatch errors.
*   AppKit don’t fully support the `ssr` flag. :::

  

### Context Provider

Let’s create now a context provider that will wrap our application and initialized AppKit (`createAppKit` needs to be called inside a Next Client Component file).

In this example we will create a file called `context/index.tsx` outside our app directory and set up the following configuration

### Layout

Next, in our `app/layout.tsx` file, we will import our `ContextProvider` component and call [the Wagmi’s function `cookieToInitialState`.](https://wagmi.sh/react/guides/ssr#_2-hydrate-the-cookie)

The `initialState` returned by `cookieToInitialState`, contains the optimistic values that will populate the Wagmi’s store both on the server and client.

Trigger the modal
-----------------

To open AppKit you can use our [**web component**](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/core/components) or build your own button with AppKit [**hooks**](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/core/hooks.mdx#useAppKit). In this example we are going to use the `<appkit-button>` component.

Web components are global html elements that don’t require importing.

Enable Wallet Detection
-----------------------

To enable AppKit to detect wallets installed on the device, you need to make specific changes to the native code of your project.

1.  Open your `Info.plist` file.
2.  Locate the `<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>` section.
3.  Add the desired wallet schemes as string entries within the `<array>`. These schemes represent the wallets you want to detect.
4.  Refer to our [Info.plist example file](https://github.com/WalletConnect/react-native-examples/blob/main/dapps/ModalUProvider/ios/ModalUProvider/Info.plist) for a detailed illustration.

Example:

Enable Coinbase Wallet
----------------------

Follow these steps to install Coinbase SDK in your project along with our Coinbase package. Check [here](https://mobilewalletprotocol.github.io/wallet-mobile-sdk/docs/client-sdk/rn-install) for more detailed information.

*   Note: Coinbase SDK is [not compatible with Expo Go](https://github.com/MobileWalletProtocol/wallet-mobile-sdk/issues/206)

1.  Enable Expo Modules in your project running:

2.  Install Coinbase SDK

3.  Install our custom connector

`yarn add @reown/appkit-coinbase-wagmi-react-native`

4.  Run pod-install

5.  Enable Deeplink handling in your project following [React Native docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/linking?syntax=ios#enabling-deep-links)
    
6.  Add Coinbase package in your AndroidManifest.xml and Info.Plist
    

7.  Add Coinbase response handler in your app. More info [here](https://mobilewalletprotocol.github.io/wallet-mobile-sdk/docs/client-sdk/rn-setup#listening-for-responses)

8.  Initialize `coinbaseConnector` and add it in `extraConnectors`

*   Prefer universal links over custom schemes to avoid an app verification warning on Coinbase Wallet

  <title>Best Practices for Wallets - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/best-practices</url>
  <content>To ensure the smoothest and most seamless experience for our users, Reown is committed to working closely with wallet providers to encourage the adoption of our recommended best practices.

By implementing these guidelines, we aim to optimize performance and minimize potential challenges, even in suboptimal network conditions.

We are actively partnering with wallet developers to optimize performance in scenarios such as:

1.  **Success and Error Messages** - Users need to know what’s going on, at all times. Too much communication is better than too little. The less users need to figure out themselves or assume what’s going on, the better.
2.  **(Perceived) Latency** - A lot of factors can influence latency (or perceived latency), e.g. network conditions, position in the boot chain, waiting on the wallet to connect or complete a transaction and not knowing if or when it has done it.
3.  **Old SDK Versions** - Older versions can have known and already fixed bugs, leading to unnecessary issues to users, which can be simply and quickly solved by updating to the latest SDK.

To take all of the above into account and to make experience better for users, we’ve put together some key guidelines for wallet providers. These best practices focus on the most important areas for improving user experience.

Please follow these best practices and make the experience for your users and yourself a delightful and quick one.

Checklist Before Going Live
---------------------------

To make sure your wallet adheres to the best practices, we recommend implementing the following checklist before going live. You can find more detailed information on each point below.

1.  **Success and Error Messages**
    *   ✅ Display clear and concise messages for all user interactions
    *   ✅ Provide feedback for all user actions
        *   ✅ Connection success
        *   ✅ Connection error
        *   ✅ Loading indicators for waiting on connection, transaction, etc.
    *   ✅ Ensure that users are informed of the status of their connection and transactions
    *   ✅ Implement status indicators internet availability
    *   ✅ Make sure to provide feedback not only to users but also back to the dapp (e.g., if there’s an error or a user has not enough funds to pay for gas, don’t just display the info message to the user, but also send the error back to the dapp so that it can change the state accordingly)
2.  **Mobile Linking**
    *   ✅ Implement mobile linking to allow for automatic redirection between the wallet and the dapp
    *   ✅ Use deep linking over universal linking for a better user experience
    *   ✅ Ensure that the user is redirected back to the dapp after completing a transaction
3.  **Latency**
    *   ✅ Optimize performance to minimize latency
    *   ✅ Latency for connection in normal conditions: under 5 seconds
    *   ✅ Latency for connection in poor network (3G) conditions: under 15 seconds
    *   ✅ Latency for signing in normal conditions: under 5 seconds
    *   ✅ Latency for signing in poor network (3G) conditions: under 10 seconds
4.  **Verify API**
    *   ✅ Present users with four key states that can help them determine whether the domain they’re about to connect to might be malicious (Domain match, Unverified, Mismatch, Threat)
5.  **Latest SDK Version**
    *   ✅ Ensure that you are using the latest SDK version
    *   ✅ Update your SDK regularly to benefit from the latest features and bug fixes
    *   ✅ Subscribe to SDK updates to stay informed about new releases

1\. Success and Error Messages
------------------------------

Users often face ambiguity in determining whether their connection or transactions were successful. They are also not guided to switching back into the dapp or automatically switched back when possible, causing unnecessary user anxiety. Additionally, wallets typically lack status indicators for connection and internet availability, leaving users in the dark.

### Pairing

A pairing is a connection between a wallet and a dapp that has fixed permissions to only allow a dapp to propose a session through it. Dapp can propose infinite number of sessions on one pairing. Wallet must use a pair method from WalletKit client to pair with dapp.

#### Pairing Expiry

A pairing expiry event is triggered whenever a pairing is expired. The expiry for inactive pairing is 5 mins, whereas for active pairing is 30 days. A pairing becomes active when a session proposal is received and user successfully approves it. This event helps to know when given pairing expires and update UI accordingly.

#### Pairing messages

1.  Consider displaying a successful pairing message when pairing is successful. Before that happens, wallet should show a loading indicator.
2.  Display an error message when a pairing fails.

#### Expected Errors

While pairing, the following errors might occur:

*   **No Internet connection error or pairing timeout when scanning QR with no Internet connection**
    *   User should pair again with Internet connection
*   **Pairing expired error when scanning a QR code with expired pairing**
    *   User should refresh a QR code and scan again
*   **Pairing with existing pairing is not allowed**
    *   User should refresh a QR code and scan again. It usually happens when user scans an already paired QR code.

### Session Proposal

A session proposal is a handshake sent by a dapp and its purpose is to define session rules. Whenever a user wants to establish a connection between a wallet and a dapp, one should approve a session proposal.

Whenever user approves or rejects a session proposal, a wallet should show a loading indicator the moment the button is pressed, until Relay acknowledgement is received for any of these actions.

#### Approving session

#### Rejecting session

#### Session proposal expiry

A session proposal expiry is 5 minutes. It means a given proposal is stored for 5 minutes in the SDK storage and user has 5 minutes for the approval or rejection decision. After that time, the below event is emitted and proposal modal should be removed from the app’s UI.

#### Session Proposal messages

1.  Consider displaying a successful session proposal message before redirecting back to the dapp. Before the success message is displayed, wallet should show a loading indicator.
2.  Display an error message when session proposal fails.

#### Expected errors

While approving or rejecting a session proposal, the following errors might occur:

*   **No Internet connection**
    *   It happens when a user tries to approve or reject a session proposal with no Internet connection
*   **Session proposal expired**
    *   It happens when a user tries to approve or reject an expired session proposal
*   **Invalid [namespaces](https://docs.reown.com/advanced/glossary#namespaces)**
    *   It happens when a validation of session namespaces fails
*   **Timeout**
    *   It happens when Relay doesn’t acknowledge session settle publish within 10s

### Session Request

A session request represents the request sent by a dapp to a wallet.

Whenever user approves or rejects a session request, a wallet should show a loading indicator the moment the button is pressed, until Relay acknowledgement is received for any of these actions.

#### Session request expiry

A session request expiry is defined by a dapp. Its value must be between `now() + 5mins` and `now() + 7 days`. After the session request expires, the below event is emitted and session request modal should be removed from the app’s UI.

#### Expected errors

While approving or rejecting a session request, the following errors might occur:

*   **Invalid session**
    *   This error might happen when a user approves or rejects a session request on an expired session
*   **Session request expired**
    *   This error might happen when a user approves or rejects a session request that already expired
*   **Timeout**
    *   It happens when Relay doesn’t acknowledge session settle publish within 10 seconds

### Connection state

The Web Socket connection state tracks the connection with the Relay server. An event is emitted whenever a connection state changes.

#### Connection state messages

When the connection state changes, show a message in the UI. For example, display a message when the connection is lost or re-established.

2\. Mobile Linking
------------------

### Why use Mobile Linking?

Mobile Linking uses the mobile device’s native OS to automatically redirect between the native wallet app and a native app. This results in few user actions a better UX.

#### Establishing Communication Between Mobile Wallets and Apps

When integrating a wallet with a mobile application, it’s essential to understand how they communicate. The process involves two main steps:

1.  **QR Code Handshake:** The mobile app (Dapp) generates a unique URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) and displays it as a QR code. This URI acts like a secret handshake. When the user scans the QR code or copy/pastes the URI using their wallet app, they establish a connection. It’s like saying, “Hey, let’s chat!”
2.  **Deep Links and Universal Links:** The URI from the QR code allows the wallet app to create a [deep link](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/10023042) or [universal link](https://developer.apple.com/ios/universal-links/). These links work on both Android and iOS. They enable seamless communication between the wallet and the app.

### Key Behavior to Address

In some scenarios, wallets use redirect metadata provided in session proposals to open applications. This can cause unintended behavior, such as:

Redirecting to the wrong app when multiple apps share the same redirect metadata (e.g., a desktop and mobile version of the same Dapp). Opening an unrelated application if a QR code is scanned on a different device than where the wallet is installed.

#### Recommended Approach

To avoid this behavior, wallets should:

*   **Restrict Redirect Metadata to Deep Link Use Cases**: Redirect metadata should only be used when the session proposal is initiated through a deep link. QR code scans should not trigger app redirects using session proposal metadata.

### Connection Flow

1.  **Dapp prompts user:** The Dapp asks the user to connect.
2.  **User chooses wallet:** The user selects a wallet from a list of compatible wallets.
3.  **Redirect to wallet:** The user is redirected to their chosen wallet.
4.  **Wallet approval:** The wallet prompts the user to approve or reject the session (similar to granting permission).
5.  **Return to dapp:**
    *   **Manual return:** The wallet asks the user to manually return to the Dapp.
    *   **Automatic return:** Alternatively, the wallet automatically takes the user back to the Dapp.
6.  **User reunites with dapp:** After all the interactions, the user ends up back in the Dapp.

### Sign Request Flow

When the Dapp needs the user to sign something (like a transaction), a similar pattern occurs:

1.  **Automatic redirect:** The Dapp automatically sends the user to their previously chosen wallet.
2.  **Approval prompt:** The wallet asks the user to approve or reject the request.
3.  **Return to dapp:**
    *   **Manual return:** The wallet asks the user to manually return to the Dapp.
    *   **Automatic return:** Alternatively, the wallet automatically takes the user back to the Dapp.
4.  **User reconnects:** Eventually, the user returns to the Dapp.

### Platform Specific Preparation

### How to Test

To experience the desired behavior, try our Sample Wallet and Dapps which use our Mobile linking best practices. These are available on all platforms.

Once you have completed your integration, you can test it against our sample apps to see if it is working as expected. Download the app and and try your mobile linking integration on your device.

*   [Sample Wallet](https://testflight.apple.com/join/09bTAryp) - on TestFlight
*   [Sample DApp](https://testflight.apple.com/join/7S1GYcjC) - on TestFlight

3\. Latency
-----------

Our SDK’s position in the boot chain can lead to up to 15 seconds in throttled network conditions. Lack of loading indicators exacerbates the perceived latency issues, impacting user experience negatively. Additionally, users often do not receive error messages or codes when issues occur or timeouts happen.

### Target latency

For **connecting**, the target latency is:

*   **Under 5 seconds** in normal conditions
*   **Under 15 seconds** when throttled (3G network speed)

For **signing**, the target latency is:

*   **Under 5 seconds** in normal conditions
*   **Under 10 seconds** when throttled (3G network speed)

### How to test

To test latency under suboptimal network conditions, you can enable throttling on your mobile phone. You can simulate different network conditions to see how your app behaves in various scenarios.

For example, on iOS you need to enable Developer Mode and then go to **Settings > Developer > Network Link Conditioner**. You can then select the network condition you want to simulate. For 3G, you can select **3G** from the list, for no network or timeout simulations, choose **100% Loss**.

Check this article for how to simulate slow internet connection on iOS & Android, with multiple options for both platforms: [How to simulate slow internet connection on iOS & Android](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/how-to-simulate-slow-network-conditions).

4\. Verify API
--------------

Verify API is a security-focused feature that allows wallets to notify end-users when they may be connecting to a suspicious or malicious domain, helping to prevent phishing attacks across the industry. Once a wallet knows whether an end-user is on uniswap.com or eviluniswap.com, it can help them to detect potentially harmful connections through Verify’s combined offering of Reown’s domain registry.

When a user initiates a connection with an application, Verify API enables wallets to present their users with four key states that can help them determine whether the domain they’re about to connect to might be malicious.

Possible states:

*   Domain match
*   Unverified
*   Mismatch
*   Threat

### Domain risk detection[](https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/web/verify#domain-risk-detection)

The Verify security system will discriminate session proposals & session requests with distinct validations that can be either `VALID`, `INVALID` or `UNKNOWN`.

*   **Domain match:** The domain linked to this request has been verified as this application’s domain.
    *   This interface appears when the domain a user is attempting to connect to has been ‘verified’ in our domain registry as the registered domain of the application the user is trying to connect to, and the domain has not returned as suspicious from either of the security tools we work with. The `verifyContext` included in the request will have a validation of `VALID`.
*   **Unverified:** The domain sending the request cannot be verified.
    *   This interface appears when the domain a user is attempting to connect to has not been verified in our domain registry, but the domain has not returned as suspicious from either of the security tools we work with. The `verifyContext` included in the request will have a validation of `UNKNOWN`.
*   **Mismatch:** The application’s domain doesn’t match the sender of this request.
    *   This interface appears when the domain a user is attempting to connect to has been flagged as a different domain to the one this application has verified in our domain registry, but the domain has not returned as suspicious from either of the security tools we work with. The `verifyContext` included in the request will have a validation of `INVALID`
*   **Threat:** This domain is flagged as malicious and potentially harmful.
    *   This interface appears when the domain a user is attempting to connect to has been flagged as malicious on one or more of the security tools we work with. The `verifyContext` included in the request will contain parameter `isScam` with value `true`.

### Verify API Implementation

To see how to implement Verify API for your framework, see [Verify API](https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/features/verify) page and select your platform to see code examples.

### How to test

To test Verify API with a malicious domain, you can check out the [Malicious React dapp](https://malicious-app-verify-simulation.vercel.app/), created specifically for testing. This app is flagged as malicious and will have the `isScam` parameter set to `true` in the `verifyContext` of the request. You can use this app to test how your wallet behaves when connecting to a malicious domain.

### Error messages

_A sample error warning when trying to connect to a malicious domain_

5\. Latest SDK
--------------

Numerous features have been introduced, bugs have been identified and fixed over time, stability has improved, but many dapps and wallets continue to use older SDK versions with known issues, affecting overall reliability.

Make sure you are using the latest version of the SDK for your platform

*   **WalletConnectSwiftV2**: [Latest release](https://github.com/reown-com/reown-swift/releases/latest/)

### Subscribe to updates

To stay up to date with the latest SDK releases, you can use GitHub’s native feature to subscribe to releases. This way, you will be notified whenever a new release is published. You can find the “Watch” button on the top right of the repository page. Click on it, then select “Custom” and “Releases only”. You’ll get a helpful ping whenever a new release is out.

  <content>Upgrade Guide
-------------

Here, you can find the guides to help you upgrade from Web3Modal v3, v4 and v5 using Wagmi to the latest Reown AppKit.

*   [Web3Modal v5 to Reown AppKit](https://docs.reown.com/_sites/docs.reown.com/appkit/upgrade/to-reown-appkit-web#web3modal-v5-to-reown-appkit---web--wagmi)
*   [Web3Modal v4 to Reown AppKit](https://docs.reown.com/_sites/docs.reown.com/appkit/upgrade/to-reown-appkit-web#web3modal-v4-to-reown-appkit---web--wagmi)
*   [Web3Modal v3 to Reown AppKit](https://docs.reown.com/_sites/docs.reown.com/appkit/upgrade/to-reown-appkit-web#web3modal-v3-to-reown-appkit---web--wagmi)

This guide will help you upgrade from Web3Modal v5 using Wagmi to the latest Reown AppKit.

**Find here all the upgrades guides:**

*   [To Reown Web AppKit using Solana](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/upgrade/to-reown-appkit-solana-web).
*   [To Reown Web AppKit using Ethers](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/upgrade/to-reown-appkit-ethers-web).
*   [To Reown Web AppKit using Ethers v5](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/upgrade/to-reown-appkit-ethers5-web).

### Installation

To upgrade from Web3Modal v5 to Reown AppKit start by removing Web3Modal v5 dependencies `@web3modal/ethereum` and `@web3modal/react`. Now you can install AppKit library and update `Wagmi` and `Viem`.

### Implementation

You can start the AppKit configuration by using either the **default** or **advanced** mode.

Default mode will implement WalletConnect, Browser Wallets (injected) and Coinbase options in addition to Wagmi’s public clients and [WalletConnect’s provider](https://docs.reown.com/cloud/blockchain-api).

Start by importing `createAppKit` from `@reown/appkit` and the necessary chains from `@reown/appkit/networks`

Then create `wagmiAdapter` using `WagmiAdapter` function as shown below

Finally, pass `wagmiAdapter` and other parameters to `createAppKit`

### Trigger the modal

**You can also use a web component to trigger the modal.** You can simply use `<appkit-button />`.

Learn more about Reown AppKit [here](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/core/installation).

### Properties

As you may have noticed, some of the properties of Web3Modal have changed as a consequence of the migration to Reown AppKit.

#### adapters

The `adapters` property is a new property that is an array of adapters that can be initialized.

#### networks

The `chains` property is now `networks` in Reown AppKit. You should import them from `@reown/appkit/networks` package instead of importing these networks from `viem` or other packages.

#### defaultNetwork

The `defaultChain` property is now `defaultNetwork` in Reown AppKit. This is a network object that specifies the default network for your Web3 app.

### Utility Functions

The following methods are still available with the same nomenclature as before:

#### modal.getAddress()

This returns the connected address.

#### modal.getError()

This returns the error values.

#### modal.getChainId()

Returns the active network’s `chainId`

#### modal.switchNetwork(network)

This switches the active network to the different network being passed.

#### modal.getIsConnected()

This returns if the selected network adapter is connected or not.

#### modal.getWalletProvider()

This returns the active connection provider.

#### modal.getWalletProviderType()

This returns the active connection provider type.

#### modal.subscribeProvider(callback)

This is a listener that detects changes to the AppKit state, such as `address`, `chainId`, `isConnected`, `provider`, and `providerType`.

*   `address` - It returns the connected wallet address. The value returned is the same as `modal.getAddress()`
*   `chainId` - It returns the active network’s `chainId` . The value returned is the same as `modal.getChainId()`
*   `isConnected` - It returns if the selected network adapter is connected. The value returned is the same as `modal.getIsConnected()`
*   `provider` - It returns the active connection provider. The value returned is the same as `modal.getWalletProvider()`
*   `providerType` - It returns the active connection provider type. The value returned is the same as `modal.getWalletProviderType()`

The following methods and listeners are exactly the same and do not have any specific details related to the multiple chains feature.

*   `modal.getState` - it returns the modal state
    *   `open` - it returns boolean that indicates if the modal is open or not
    *   `selectedNetworkId` - it returns active network’s id
*   `modal.subscribeState`
*   `modal.setThemeMode`
*   `modal.getThemeMode`
*   `modal.setThemeVariables`
*   `modal.getThemeVariables`
*   `modal.subscribeTheme`
*   `modal.getEvent`
*   `modal.subscribeEvents`

Web3Modal v4 to Reown AppKit - Web | Wagmi
------------------------------------------

### Installation

  <title>Upgrade from Web3Modal to Reown AppKit for iOS - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/upgrade/from-web3modal-ios</url>
  <content>This upgrade guide is intended to help developers transition their projects from using Web3Modal to the AppKit. The changes involve updating imports, modifying method calls, changing the repository URL for Swift Package Manager (SPM), and adjusting instance and configuration methods. Follow the steps below to migrate smoothly.

### Step 1. Update the Repository URL

The Web3Modal project has moved from the WalletConnect organization to a new repository under the reown-com organization. If you are using Swift Package Manager (SPM) to manage dependencies, update your Package.swift file to point to the new repository:

### Step 2. Update Imports in Your Code

All references to Web3Modal in your import statements should be changed to AppKit.

### Step 3. Update Instance Access and Method Calls

The singleton instance access for Web3Modal has been replaced with AppKit. Update all instances where Web3Modal.instance is used to AppKit.instance.

### Step 4. Update Configuration Method

The configure method has also been updated to reflect the new branding. Replace calls to Web3Modal.configure with AppKit.configure. Old Configuration:

### Step 5. Test Your Changes

  <title>Content Security Policy (CSP) - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/advanced/security/content-security-policy</url>
  <content>Overview
--------

A Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security feature that helps protect web applications from various attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and data injection. By specifying allowed content sources, CSPs minimize the risk of executing malicious content on your site.

CSP Guidance
------------

### AppKit

The following is a **partial CSP** that covers WalletConnect’s libraries and services for [AppKit](https://docs.walletconnect.com/appkit/overview). Note that **you may need to define additional sources based on your application’s requirements**.

Testing and Deploying Your CSP
------------------------------

### Test Your CSP in a Staging Environment

Run through your standard user flows in a staging environment with CSP enforcement. This may include connecting to browser extension wallets, transacting, logging out, etc. Directives may need updates after SDK upgrades. Always test your CSP again before deploying updates to production.

### Using Report-Only Mode

Use the `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` header, which sends violation reports without enforcing policies. This helps assess the impact of CSP changes without affecting functionality.

### Deployment

First deploy your CSP in `report-only` mode. After validation, migrate to `Content-Security-Policy` for enforcement.

### Monitoring

Configure `report-uri` or `report-to` to receive violation reports and set up a monitoring dashboard for review.</content>

  <title>Upgrade from Web3Wallet to WalletKit for iOS - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/upgrade/from-web3wallet-ios</url>
  <content>This upgrade guide helps developers transition from using the Web3Wallet library to the WalletKit within reown-swift. The guide involves updating import statements, modifying instance references, changing configuration methods, and updating repository URLs for CocoaPods and Swift Package Manager (SPM).

### Step 1. Update the Repository URL

The Web3Wallet library has been moved to a new repository under the reown-com organization. If you are using Swift Package Manager (SPM) to manage dependencies, update your Package.swift file to point to the new repository:

### Step 2. Update Imports in Your Code

All references to Web3Wallet in your import statements should be updated to use WalletKit.

### Step 3. Update Instance Access and Method Calls

The singleton instance access for Web3Wallet has been replaced with WalletKit. Update all instances where Web3Wallet.instance is used to WalletKit.instance.

### Step 4. Update Configuration Method

The configure method has been updated to reflect the new branding. Replace calls to Web3Wallet.configure with WalletKit.configure.

### Step 5. Update CocoaPods Podspec

If you are using CocoaPods to manage dependencies, update your Podfile to use the new library name.

### Step 6. Test Your Changes

After updating all references to Web3Wallet to use WalletKit, thoroughly test your application to ensure that all functionalities work as expected.

Pairing Expiry
--------------

Currently, Dapps create a new pairing whenever the user selects the **“Connect Wallet”** button, instead of reusing existing pairings. Although pairings were not intended to be reused, they were being persisted for 30 days, causing unnecessary resource usage for both Dapps and wallet clients, including redundant socket connections.

This led to an accumulation of stale pairings in wallets, resulting in degraded efficiency and increased resource consumption. To address this issue, we have introduced changes to how pairings are managed to ensure more efficient connection handling.

Pairings were never intended to be listed in the wallet, and wallets should only display active sessions to users.

WebSocket Connection Handling
-----------------------------

We’ve optimized the WebSocket connection management to improve performance and resource utilization. The SDK will now establish a WebSocket connection only when there’s an explicit intention to send a request or subscribe to a topic. If none of these conditions are met, the WebSocket connection will remain closed by default.

### What’s Changed?

Previous Behavior: The SDK automatically initiated a WebSocket connection upon startup, regardless of active sessions or pending actions.

New Behavior: The SDK delays establishing a WebSocket connection until it’s necessary based on the app’s activities.

### Why This Change?

This adjustment reduces unnecessary network traffic and conserves device resources, leading to better performance and battery life, especially important for mobile applications.

### Impact on Your Application

Disconnected State on Launch: Apps without active sessions at launch will start with the WebSocket in a disconnected state. UI Elements Depending on WebSocket: Buttons or features that rely on an active WebSocket connection may not function until the connection is established.

### Steps for Migration

Wallets are no longer expected to handle pairing-related methods. If your wallet has been listing pairings, please replace this with listing active sessions instead.</content>

  <title>Upgrade from Web3Modal to Reown AppKit on Unity - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/upgrade/from-web3modal-unity</url>
  <content>This document outlines the steps to migrate from the old `com.walletconnect` packages to the new `com.reown` package in your Unity project.

### Step 1. Replace the corresponding dependency in your manifest.json

Alternatively, you can use the OpenUPM CLI:

If the `com.walletconnect.web3modal` package was installed manually via the Package Manager window or directly from the GitHub repository, remove all `com.walletconnect` packages and replace them with the `com.reown` packages. You can find the list of all necessary packages in the [Installation Documentation](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/unity/core/installation#package) under `Package Manager with OpenUPM` tab.

### Step 2. Update your AppKit config

The `com.walletconnect.web3modal` package used two configuration objects: `WalletConnectProjectConfig` scriptable object and optional `Web3ModalConfig` class.

The Reown AppKit combines these two configurations into a single `AppKitConfig` class that can be passed into AppKit initialization method.

1.  Delete `WalletConnectProjectConfig` scriptable object
2.  Initialize AppKit from your script

### Step 3. Update references to the namespaces

The modern IDE such as Rider or Visual Studio should be able to automatically update the namespaces for you. If not, you can manually update the namespaces as follows:

Note that some objects from `WalletConnectUnity.Core` were moved into `Reown.AppKit.Unity` namespace, therefore we recommend to rely on the IDE to automatically update the namespaces.

### Step 4. Update references to the classes

Change `Web3Modal` to `AppKit` in your codebase. For example:

### Step 5. Rename USS variables

If you customized any AppKit USS variables, simply change `--wui` part of the variable name to `--ro`. For example:

### Final notes

*   Ensure that you have updated all relevant configurations and imports in your project to reflect the changes from Web3Modal to AppKit.
*   Test your application thoroughly to ensure that the migration has been successful and that all functionality is working as expected.</content>

  <title>One-click Auth - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/android/one-click-auth</url>
  <content>Introduction
------------

This section outlines an innovative protocol method that facilitates the initiation of a Sign session and the authentication of a wallet through a [Sign-In with Ethereum](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361) (SIWE) message, enhanced by [ReCaps](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5573) (ReCap Capabilities).

This enhancement not only offers immediate authentication for dApps, paving the way for prompt user logins, but also integrates informed consent for authorization. Through this mechanism, dApps can request the delegation of specific capabilities to perform actions on behalf of the wallet user. These capabilities, encapsulated within SIWE messages as ReCap URIs, detail the scope of actions authorized by the user in an explicit and human-readable form.

By incorporating ReCaps, this method extends the utility of SIWE messages, allowing dApps to combine authentication with a nuanced authorization model. This model specifies the actions a dApp is authorized to execute on the user’s behalf, enhancing security and user autonomy by providing clear consent for each delegated capability. As a result, dApps can utilize these consent-backed messages to perform predetermined actions, significantly enriching the interaction between dApps, wallets, and users within the Ethereum ecosystem.

Handling Authentication Requests
--------------------------------

To handle incoming authentication requests, set up WalletKit.WalletDelegate. The onSessionAuthenticate callback will notify you of any authentication requests that need to be processed, allowing you to either approve or reject them based on your application logic.

Authentication Objects/Payloads
-------------------------------

#### Responding to Authentication Requests

To interact with authentication requests, build authentication objects (Wallet.Model.Cacao). It involves the following steps:

*   **Creating an Authentication Payload Params** - Generate an authentication payload params that matches your application’s supported chains and methods.
*   **Formatting Authentication Messages** - Format the authentication message using the payload and the user’s account.
*   **Signing the Authentication Message** - Sign the formatted message to create a verifiable authentication object.

Example:

Approving Authentication Requests
---------------------------------

To approve an authentication request, construct Wallet.Model.Cacao instances for each supported chain, sign the authentication messages, generate AuthObjects and call approveSessionAuthenticate with the request ID and the authentication objects.

Rejecting Authentication Requests
---------------------------------

If the authentication request cannot be approved or if the user chooses to reject it, use the rejectSessionAuthenticate method.

Testing One-click Auth
----------------------

You can use [AppKit Lab](https://appkit-lab.reown.com/library/ethers-siwe/) to test and verify that your wallet supports One-click Auth properly.

Handling Authentication Requests
--------------------------------

To handle incoming authentication requests, subscribe to the authenticateRequestPublisher. This will notify you of any authentication requests that need to be processed, allowing you to either approve or reject them based on your application logic.

Authentication Objects/Payloads
-------------------------------

To interact with authentication requests, first build authentication objects (AuthObject). These objects are crucial for approving authentication requests. This involves:

*   **Creating an Authentication Payload** - Generate an authentication payload that matches your application’s supported chains and methods.
*   **Formatting Authentication Messages** - Format the authentication message using the payload and the user’s account.
*   **Signing the Authentication Message** - Sign the formatted message to create a verifiable authentication object.

Example Implementation:

Approving Authentication Requests
---------------------------------

To approve an authentication request, construct AuthObject instances for each supported blockchain, sign the authentication messages, build AuthObjects and call approveSessionAuthenticate with the request ID and the authentication objects.

Rejecting Authentication Requests
---------------------------------

If the authentication request cannot be approved or if the user chooses to reject it, use the rejectSession method.

Testing One-click Auth

  <title>Multichain - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/core/multichain</url>
  <content>AppKit is now multichain. The architecture is designed to support both EVM and non-EVM blockchains. This will allow developers and projects to choose and configure multiple blockchain networks within their instance of AppKit, extending beyond just Ethereum-based (EVM) networks.

Currently, AppKit supports two non-EVM networks, they are, **Solana** and **Bitcoin**. Soon, AppKit will support Polkadot and Cosmos, allowing projects to tap into users from these different blockchain ecosystems. This will enable developers and projects to reach a broader audience and interact with multiple blockchain networks, all through a single wallet provider.

Installation
------------

Integration
-----------

The AppKit instance allows you to support multiple chains by importing the respective chains, creating the respective network adapters and passing these within the `createAppKit()` function.

Depending on the network adapter of your preference (`Wagmi`, `Ethers`, `Ethers5`), the integration may vary. Let’s look at what the integration will look like.</content>

  <title>Sponsored Transactions - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/transactions/sponsored-transactions</url>
  <content>Sponsored transactions is an umbrella term for multiple methods of utilizing [ERC 7677](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7677) paymasters. There are 2 types of paymasters that AppKit supports:

*   ERC 20 Paymasters
*   Verifying Paymasters

This approach simplifies blockchain interactions by enabling users to perform actions without directly handling transaction fees, which are instead paid by the dApp. This concept is particularly beneficial for attracting new users, as it removes the need to understand complex wallet mechanics or hold cryptocurrency for gas fees, making the overall experience more intuitive and accessible.

By absorbing these costs, dApps can offer a smoother onboarding experience.

ERC 20 Paymasters
-----------------

ERC 20 paymasters allow end users (smart account wallets) to cover transaction fees without using a network’s native gas token. In essence, this gives the ability to cover transaction fees using ERC 20 tokens like USDC.

Verifying Paymasters
--------------------

Verifying Paymasters are more involved, in that they are typically used alongside some policies that determine whether or not a transaction’s entire gas fee will be covered by the paymaster. For example, only sponsor transactions that interact with a specific smart account, accessing a particular method.

### Using A Paymaster URL

Using a paymaster as a dapp involves leveraging the `capabilities` field present in [EIP 5792](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5792) calls. Setting a field like so:

Where `calls` is an array of 5792 calls to send, `paymasterServiceUrl` is a string containing the paymaster URL and `context` is an optional configuration object for the paymaster.

The `context` field is paymaster specific and it might be required depending on the Paymaster implementation.

* * *

As a Dapp, that is all that is required to take advantage of verifying paymasters. The rest would be handled wallet side. If the calls match the criteria set in the paymaster’s policy, then the calls’ gas would be sponsored. However, if it does not, then the transaction would be cancelled.

Example implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/blob/main/apps/laboratory/src/components/Wagmi/WagmiSendCallsWithPaymasterServiceTest.tsx#L137).

### A Note on ERC20 Paymaster integration

As of right now, ERC20 paymasters would require to provide a context on the tokens to use for gas payment. How to get this context is not yet standardized and is up to the dapp to integrate with their provider in order to fetch available tokens and other required implementation-specific context data.

### A Note on Wallets

As of right now, not many smart account wallets support paymasters, however AppKit’s embedded smart account covers full compatibility with ERC7677 paymasters.

### A Note on Paymasters

Reown is developing a paymaster service (currently in beta) which will allow very flexible policy management, reducing the need for writing complex code to verify whether or not a sponsorship should go through.

Users can also discover Notify-compatible apps in their wallet or the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/) to subscribe to.

AppKit Notifications is not to be confused with the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/) which allows users to receive and manage their notifications from all apps, as they would in a wallet.

Getting Started
---------------

AppKit Notifications can be added to your app in a few steps:

*   [Setup your project](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/vue/notifications/cloud-setup) to send authenticated notifications.
*   Use our [frontend SDK](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/vue/notifications/frontend-integration/usage) to enable users to subscribe to notifications in your app.
*   Finally, use [Reown Cloud](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/vue/notifications/cloud-sending) or our [API in your backend](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/vue/notifications/backend-integration) to send notifications to subscribed users.

Overview
--------

Some of the key features of AppKit Notifications include:

*   **Device push notifications:** Push notifications to the user’s wallet (if it supports Notify API) or the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/).
*   **Notification history:** Notifications are stored and can be accessed from any device.
*   **Spam protection/subscription control.** Using notification types, subscribers can opt-out of certain notification types they do not want to receive.
*   **Tracking read status across devices.**

Subscribing and receiving notifications
---------------------------------------

Users can receive notifications in several places:

*   In the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/) which supports push notifications and can be installed to the user’s phone
*   In your app’s frontend using our [frontend SDK](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/vue/notifications/frontend-integration/usage)
*   Natively in their wallet if the wallet supports Notify API.
    *   You can also test with one of our sample wallets:
        *   [iOS sample wallet](https://testflight.apple.com/join/09bTAryp)
        *   [Android sample wallet](https://appdistribution.firebase.dev/i/d2c86e879abd5a86)

Users can also subscribe to notifications in all of the above locations too. To be discoverable in the Web3Inbox.com app or in wallets, apps must submit an explorer listing.

  <title>Email & Socials - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/core/socials</url>
  <content>To allow users to authenticate using their email or social accounts, you need to configure the `features` parameter in the `createAppKit` function.

Options
-------

*   _**email \[boolean\]**_ : This boolean defines whether you want to enable email login. Default `true`
*   _**socials \[array\]**_ : This array contains the list of social platforms that you want to enable for user authentication. The platforms in the example include Google, X, GitHub, Discord, Apple, Facebook and Farcaster. The default value of `undefined` displays everything. Set it to `false` to disable this feature. You can also pass an empty array to disable it.
*   _**emailShowWallets \[boolean\]**_ : This boolean defines whether you want to show the wallet options on the first connect screen. If this is false and `socials` are enabled, it will show a button that directs you to a new screen displaying the wallet options. Default `true`

User flow
---------

1.  Users will be able to connect to you application by simply using an email address. AppKit will send to them a One Time Password (OTP) to copy and paste in the modal, which will help to verify the user’s authenticity. This will create a non-custodial wallet for your user which will be available in any application that integrates AppKit and email login.
    
2.  Eventually the user can optionally choose to move from a non-custodial wallet to a self-custodial one by pressing “Upgrade Wallet” on AppKit. This will open the _([WalletConnect secure website](https://secure.walletconnect.com/dashboard))_ that will walk your user through the upgrading process.
    

UI Variants
-----------

AppKit SDK offers multiple UI variants to customize the user experience for the authentication process.

By configuring the `emailShowWallets` option in the `features` parameter, you can control the initial connect screen behavior:

*   **`emailShowWallets: true`**: When this option is enabled, the initial connect screen will display the available wallet options directly to the user. This allows users to choose their preferred wallet immediately.

*   **`emailShowWallets: false`**: If this option is disabled, the initial connect screen will show a button instead. When the user clicks this button, they will be directed to a new screen that lists all the available wallet options. This can help simplify the initial interface and reduce visual clutter.

By configuring the `socials` option in the `features` parameter, you can control the amount of social providers you want to show on the connect screen:

*   **`socials: ['google']`**: When you only set one social provider, it will give you a button with \`connect with provider.

*   **`socials: ['google', 'discord']`**: When you set 2 social provider, it will give you 2 buttons next to each other with the logo of the social provider

*   **`socials: ['google', 'x', 'discord', 'apple', 'github']`**: When you set more than 2 social providers, the first provider in the array will get a button with `connect with provider`. The other providers will get a button with the logo of the social provider next to each other.

*   **`socials: []` or `socials: false`**: When you want to disable social logins.

*   **`email: false`**: When you want to disable email login.

By configuring the `allWallets` option inside the `createAppKit` function, you can control whether if and when you want to display all wallets.

*   **`allWallets: 'HIDE'`**: When you do not want to display all wallets.

*   **`allWallets: 'SHOW'`**: When you want to display all wallets.

*   **`allWallets: 'ONLY_MOBILE'`**: When you want to display all wallets only on a mobile device.</content>

  <title>One-Click Auth / SIWE - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/core/siwe</url>
  <content>AppKit provides a simple solution for integrating with “Sign In With Ethereum” (SIWE), a new form of authentication that enables users to control their digital identity with their Ethereum account. SIWE is a standard also known as [EIP-4361](https://docs.login.xyz/general-information/siwe-overview/eip-4361).

**One-Click Auth** represents a key advancement within WalletConnect v2, streamlining the user authentication process in AppKit by enabling them to seamlessly connect with a wallet and sign a SIWE message with just one click.

It supports both [EIP-1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271), the standard for signature validation in smart accounts, and [EIP-6492](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6492), which enables signature validation for smart accounts (contracts) that are not yet deployed, allowing messages to be signed without requiring prior deployment.

Connecting a wallet, proving control of an address with an off-chain signature, authorizing specific actions. These are the kinds of authorizations that can be encoded as [“ReCaps”](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5573). ReCaps are permissions for a specific website or dapp that can be compactly encoded as a long string in the message you sign and translated by any wallet into a straight-forward one-sentence summary. reown uses permissions expressed as ReCaps to enable a One-Click Authentication.

Installation
------------

Configure your SIWE Client
--------------------------

[

React SIWE Example
------------------

Check the client/server React example



](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit-web-examples/tree/main/react/react-siwe-server-example)

Server Side
-----------

Setting up a backend server using Express for a web application that interacts with the Siwe protocol.

### Routes:

*   GET ‘/nonce’: Generates and returns a nonce (single-use random number).
*   POST ‘/verify’: Uses the Siwe protocol to verify the message, requiring a signature (the one you are going to approve throw the UX) and a nonce stored in the session.
*   GET ‘/session’: Retrieves the stored Siwe object from the session.
*   GET ‘/signout’: Clears the session.

Check the github full example to see the full flow working: [siwe-quickstart](https://github.com/WalletConnect/web-examples/tree/main/dapps/appkit-siwe/react/)

### `verifySignature`

Verify a SIWE signature.

Initialize AppKit with your `siweConfig`
----------------------------------------

Add the `siweConfig` to your createAppKit parameters

SIWE Config Parameters
----------------------

#### getMessageParams `() => Promise<{ domain: string, uri: string, chains: number[], statement: string }>`

Parameters to create the SIWE message internally.

#### getNonce `() => Promise<string>`

The getNonce method functions as a safeguard against spoofing, akin to a CSRF token. The siwe package provides a generateNonce() helper, or you can utilize an existing CSRF token from your backend if available.

#### createMessage `(args: SIWECreateMessageArgs) => string`

The official siwe package offers a straightforward method for generating an EIP-4361-compatible message, which can subsequently be authenticated using the same package. The nonce parameter is derived from your getNonce endpoint, while the address and chainId variables are sourced from the presently connected wallet.

#### verifyMessage `(args: SIWEVerifyMessageArgs) => Promise<boolean>`

The function to ensure the message is valid, has not been tampered with, and has been appropriately signed by the wallet address.

#### getSession `() => Promise<SIWESession | null>`

The backend session should store the associated address and chainId and return it via the `getSession` method.

#### signOut `() => Promise<boolean>`

The users session can be destroyed calling `signOut`.

#### onSignIn `(session?: SIWESession) => void`

Callback when user signs in (Optional).

#### onSignOut `() => void`

Callback when user signs out (Optional).

#### signOutOnDisconnect `boolean`

*   defaults to `true`

Whether or not to sign out when the user disconnects their wallet (Optional).

This will create a non-custodial wallet for your user which will be available in any application that integrates AppKit and email login. Alternatively, users can connect using social accounts.
    
2.  Eventually the user can optionally choose to move from a non-custodial wallet to a self-custodial one by pressing “Upgrade Wallet” on AppKit (currently only visible on WebGL). This will open the _([WalletConnect secure website](https://secure.walletconnect.com/dashboard))_ that will walk your user through the upgrading process.
    

Integration
-----------

Email and Social login options are enabled by default. You can disable them or modify the list of social platforms by setting the `enableEmail` and `socials` parameters in the `AppKitConfig` object.

### Options

*   **enableEmail**: This boolean defines whether you want to enable email login. Defaults to `true`.
*   **socials**: This array contains the list of social platforms that you want to enable for user authentication. Set it to `null` or empty array to disable social login.

UI Variants
-----------

AppKit SDK offers multiple UI variants to customize the user experience for the authentication process. Note, that the UI can be slightly different depending on the platform.

By configuring the `socials` option in the `AppKitConfig` object, you can control the amount of social providers you want to show on the connect screen:

*   **`socials: new[] { SocialLogin.Google }`**: When you only set one social provider, it will give you a button with `connect with provider`.
    
*   **`socials: new[] { SocialLogin.Google, SocialLogin.Discord }`**: When you set 2 social providers, it will give you 2 buttons next to each other with the logo of the social provider
    
*   **`socials: new[] {SocialLogin.Google, SocialLogin.X, SocialLogin.Discord, SocialLogin.Apple, SocialLogin.Github}`**: When you set more than 2 social providers, the first provider in the array will get a button with `connect with provider`. The other providers will get a button with the logo of the social provider next to each other.
    
*   **`socials: Array.Empty<SocialLogin>()` or `socials: null`**: When you want to disable social logins.
    

Actions
-------

AppKit provides methods to initiate social login connections programmatically, allowing you to build custom UI elements that trigger the authentication flow.</content>

  <content>AppKit provides a simple solution for integrating with “Sign In With Ethereum” (SIWE), a new form of authentication that enables users to control their digital identity with their Ethereum account. SIWE is a standard also known as [EIP-4361](https://docs.login.xyz/general-information/siwe-overview/eip-4361).

One-Click Auth
--------------

**One-Click Auth** represents a key advancement within WalletConnect v2, streamlining the user authentication process in AppKit by enabling them to seamlessly connect with a wallet and sign a SIWE message with just one click. It supports both [EIP-1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271), the standard for signature validation in smart accounts, and [EIP-6492](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6492), which enables signature validation for smart accounts (contracts) that are not yet deployed, allowing messages to be signed without requiring prior deployment.

Connecting a wallet, proving control of an address with an off-chain signature, authorizing specific actions. These are the kinds of authorizations that can be encoded as [“ReCaps”](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5573). ReCaps are permissions for a specific website or dapp that can be compactly encoded as a long string in the message you sign and translated by any wallet into a straight-forward one-sentence summary. WalletConnect uses permissions expressed as ReCaps to enable a One-Click Authentication.

SIWE is a standard also known as [EIP-4361](https://docs.login.xyz/general-information/siwe-overview/eip-4361).

One-Click Auth
--------------

One-Click Auth represents a key advancement within WalletConnect v2, streamlining the user authentication process in AppKit by enabling them to seamlessly connect with a wallet and sign a SIWE message with just one click. Connecting a wallet, proving control of an address with an off-chain signature, authorizing specific actions. These are the kinds of authorizations that can be encoded as “ReCaps”. ReCaps are permissions for a specific website or dapp that can be compactly encoded as a long string in the message you sign and translated by any wallet into a straight-forward one-sentence summary. WalletConnect uses permissions expressed as ReCaps to enable a One-Click Authentication.

Configure your AppKit Client
----------------------------

To integrate SIWE with AppKit, you need to configure your AppKit client using `Modal.Model.AuthPayloadParams`, which are required to create a SIWE message for the user to sign:

#### Example of AuthRequestParams

Configuring your AppKit client with Modal.Model.AuthPayloadParams will prioritize authentication requests over regular session proposals. If the wallet supports One-Click Auth, the session will be created and the user will automatically authenticate without needing to send another SIWE request over personal\_sign. If the wallet does not support One-Click Auth, it will fall back to the session proposal. In this case, to authenticate the user, AppKit will send another session request to prove address ownership.

To check whether the user has signed a SIWE message, check `onSessionAuthenticateResponse` callback from `AppKit.ModalDelegate`:

### Fallback to SIWE Over Session Request

If the wallet connecting to your dapp does not support One-Click Auth, the SDK will fallback to the `wc_sessionPropose` method and create a session with the wallet. AppKit will then inform the user that they need to sign a message to prove address ownership. AppKit will send a SIWE request to the wallet, and once the wallet responds with a signed message, use `onSIWEAuthenticationResponse` callback to check the result:

### Link Mode

The latest release of AppKit supports link mode, a low latency mechanism for transporting One-Click Auth requests and session requests over universal links, reducing the need for a WebSocket connection with the Relay. This significantly enhances the user experience when connecting native dApps to native wallets by reducing the latency associated with networking connections, especially when the user has an unstable internet connection.

To support link mode, configure your AppMetaData `appLink` with a valid universal link and set the `linkMode` property to `true`:

Once link mode is configured, your dApp will connect and send requests to wallets via app links after receiving proof from the wallet that it also supports link mode.

The wallet will also send responses using app links. Your app needs to pass these responses to the AppKit client so it can process them.

Ensure to handle incoming app links in your Activity onCreate method and in onNewIntent callback.

Ensure that your App Link is properly configured in your app’s Manifest file with the `autoVerify` set to `true`:

_One-Click Auth_ represents a key advancement within WalletConnect v2, streamlining the user authentication process in AppKit by enabling them to seamlessly connect with a wallet and sign a SIWE message with just one click.

Connecting a wallet, proving control of an address with an off-chain signature, authorizing specific actions.

ReCaps are permissions for a specific website or dapp that can be compactly encoded as a long string in the message you sign and translated by any wallet into a straight-forward one-sentence summary. WalletConnect uses permissions expressed as ReCaps to enable a One-Click Authentication.

Local Address Verification
--------------------------

When connecting wallets to applications using the WalletConnect protocol, the wallet supplies a list of accounts. However, there is a potential risk that the wallet could provide an address the user does not control. To mitigate this account spoofing risk, the standard practice is to require the user to sign a message with the provided address and then verify the signature.

The Sign-In With Ethereum (SIWE) feature in AppKit can facilitate this verification process, enabling the application to confirm the user’s Ethereum address even the app doesn’t have a backend.

### 0\. Create basic SIWE configuration

### 1\. Initialize AppKit with your `SiweConfig`

Add the SIWE configuration to `AppKitConfig`

With this configuration, AppKit will enforce address verification and invoke the `SignInSuccess` delegate when the user successfully verifies the address.

To use 1-CA + SIWE at full extend, a backend for communication is required. This backend will be used to generate a nonce, verify messages and handle sessions. You can read more about SIWE backend implementation at [here](https://docs.login.xyz/sign-in-with-ethereum/quickstart-guide/implement-the-backend).

  <content>### Explorer recommended wallets

Allows to set default recommended wallets that are fetched from [WalletGuide](https://walletguide.walletconnect.network/). You can define a list of wallets ids you’d like to prioritize (order is respected). You can get these ids from the explorer link mentioned before by clicking on a copy icon of your desired wallet card.

### Explorer excluded wallets

Allows to exclude wallets that are fetched from [WalletGuide](https://walletguide.walletconnect.network/). You can define an array of wallet ids you’d like to exclude. You can get these ids from the explorer link mentioned before by clicking on a copy icon of your desired wallet card.

### Add custom wallets

If you want to list wallet that is not included in the explorer, you can configure the client as follows:

### Enable Installed Wallet Detection

To enable AppKit to detect wallets installed on the device, you need to make specific changes your project Info.plist.

#### For iOS:

1.  Open your `Info.plist` file.
2.  Locate the `<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>` section.
3.  Add the desired wallet schemes as string entries within the `<array>`. These schemes represent the wallets you want to detect.
4.  Refer to our [Info.plist example file](https://github.com/WalletConnect/react-native-examples/blob/main/dapps/ModalUProvider/ios/ModalUProvider/Info.plist) for a detailed illustration.

Example:

### Enable Coinbase Wallet

Since Coinbase Wallet uses its own SDK there are a few simply steps to do if you are planning to include and support it

1.  Open your `Info.plist` file.
2.  Locate the `<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>` section.
3.  Include `<string>cbwallet</string>` scheme as mentioned above in previous section

Example:

Then you need to add the following code to your `AppDelegate.swift` file

or for SwiftUI attach `onOpenURL` modifier somewhere in your view hierarchy like shown below.</content>

  <content>### Configure Networking and Pair clients

Make sure that you properly configure Networking and Pair Clients first.

*   [Networking](https://docs.reown.com/advanced/api/core/relay)

### Initialize AppKit Client

In order to initialize a client just call a `configure` method from the AppKit instance wrapper

This example will default to using following namespaces.

If you want to change that you can call configure and define your own session parameters like this.

or you can change them later by calling `AppKit.set(sessionParams: SessionParams(...))`

### Provided UI components

Now you can use the `AppKitButton` or `AppKitNetworkButton` components. These two components reflect the state of the AppKit client, including the session state, account address and balance, currently selected network, and will automatically update when the state changes. More can be found in [https://github.com/reown-com/reown-swift/blob/develop/Sample/Example/ContentView.swift](https://github.com/reown-com/reown-swift/blob/develop/Sample/Example/ContentView.swift) as part of the Sample app.

### Custom UI

If you want to use custom UI you can present the modal by simply calling.

It will traverse the view hierarchy and try to present from top most controller. This is meant more towards SwiftUI.

Otherwise you can specify the viewController to present from.

### Subscribe for AppKit Publishers

The following publishers are available to subscribe:

### Sign methods

AppKit is internally using Sign SDK and most of its method are being exposed through AppKit interface.

### Where to go from here

  <title>Verify - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/ios/cloud/verify</url>
  <content>Verify API is a security-focused feature that allows wallets to notify end-users when they may be connecting to a suspicious or malicious domain, helping to prevent phishing attacks across the industry.

Once a wallet knows whether an end-user is on uniswap.com or eviluniswap.com, it can help them to detect potentially harmful connections through Verify’s combined offering of Reown’s domain registry.

Cloud Verification
------------------

In order to verify your app domain in Reown Cloud follow these steps:

1.  Head over to [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/)
    
2.  Create a new project or click on the project you would like to verify.
    
3.  On the settings tab, head over to the ‘Domain verification’ section and fill in the website URL that you wish to verify.
    

4.  Click on the copy button and head over to your domain Name Registrar/Provider to edit your DNS records. Alternatively, if you can’t manage DNS records for your project (eg: ENS or vercel.app) you can host a static file under `/.well-known/walletconnect.txt` which contains the entire verification code that you copied. If you are using the static file method, you can jump over step 7.
    
5.  Under `Type`, select `TXT`. In the “Answer” section, paste the text you copied from the cloud dashboard. This field may vary across DNS dashboards. If you’re trying to register a subdomain, add it under `Host`. Feel free to leave TTL at its default value.
    

6.  Depending on your DNS settings, this might take a while to reflect. You can check out DNS settings for your website with CLI tools like Dig or with websites like [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=txt)
    
7.  Once this is done and you have confirmed this change is reflected, head on back to your Cloud Dashboard and click on Verify.
    

8.  You should see a toast pop up in the bottom right section of your screen and the domain verification section should have a green tick next to it.</content>

  <title>Relay - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/ios/cloud/relay</url>
  <content>Project ID
----------

The Project ID is consumed through URL parameters.

URL parameters used:

*   `projectId`: Your Project ID can be obtained from [cloud.reown.com](https://cloud.reown.com/)

Example URL:

`https://relay.walletconnect.com/?projectId=c4f79cc821944d9680842e34466bfbd`

This can be instantiated from the client with the `projectId` in the `SignClient` constructor.

Allowlist
---------

To help prevent malicious use of your project ID you are strongly encouraged to set an allowlist of [origins](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin) or application/bundle ids for mobile applications where the project ID is used. Requests from other origins will be denied.

*   Allowlist supports a list of origins in the format `[scheme://]<hostname[:port]`.
*   [Application ID](https://developer.android.com/build/configure-app-module#set-application-id)/[Bundle IDs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/bundle_ids) typically are defined using the [reverse domain name notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation)

Using `localhost` (or `127.0.0.1`) is always permitted, and if empty all origins are allowed. Updates take 15 minutes to apply.

If scheme or port is specified, it must match exactly. Hostname must also match exactly, but wildcards can be used for individual labels within the hostname.

Example of possible origins in the allowlist:

*   `example.com` - allows `https://example.com` or `http://example.com` but not `https://www.example.com`
*   `https://example.com` - allows `https://example.com` but not `http://example.com`
*   `https://www.example.com` - allows `https://www.example.com` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://example.com:8080` - allows `https://example.com:8080` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://*.example.com` - allows `https://www.example.com` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://*.*.example.com` - allows `https://www.subdomain.example.com` but not `https://www.example.com` or `https://example.com`
*   `https://www.*.example.com` - allows `https://www.subdomain.example.com` but not `https://www.example.com`
*   `https://www-*.example.com` - invalid; `*` must be the full label

Error Codes
-----------

| Reason | Error Code |
| --- | --- |
| Project ID doesn’t exist OR JWT is expired | 401 |
| Exists and is invalid | 403 |
| Too many requests | 1013 |

Websocket Close Codes
---------------------

| Code | Description | Reconnect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1001 | Server terminating | Yes |
| 4008 | Client stale: connected without a prior subscription and is not sending data | When needed |
| 4010 | Load Rebalancing | Yes |

Best Practices
--------------

*   Create a new `projectId` for each project. This allows for more granular control, dedicated explorer listings, and project metrics.
*   Don’t reuse a `projectId`.
*   Use the AllowList to limit unauthorized usage.
*   Avoid committing projects keys to the repo. Use env variables instead.

  <title>Smart Accounts - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/core/smart-accounts</url>
  <content>Overview
--------

Smart Accounts (SAs) are enabled by default within AppKit. These accounts enhance functionality by emitting 1271 and 6492 signatures, which should be taken into account for signature verification processes, such as Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE).

### Deployment

Smart Accounts are deployed alongside the first transaction. Until deployment, a precalculated address, known as the counterfactual address, is displayed. Despite not being deployed, the account can still sign using 6492 signatures.

### Supported Networks

Smart Accounts are available on the following networks:

*   Base Sepolia
*   BSC (Binance Smart Chain)
*   Fraximal
*   Linea
*   Mode
*   Optimism
*   Polygon
*   Polygon Mumbai
*   Sepolia

### User Eligibility

Smart Accounts are exclusively available for embedded wallet users (email and social login)

FAQ
---

### What is a Smart Account?

A Smart Account improves the traditional account experience by replacing Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) with a Smart Contract that follows the [ERC-4337 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337). This opens up many use cases that were previously unavailable.

Smart Accounts do no require Private Keys or Seed Phrases, instead they rely on a key or multiple keys from designated signers to access the smart account and perform actions on chain. The keys can take multiple forms including passkeys and EOA signatures.

### What can I do with a Smart Account?

Smart accounts unlock a host of use cases that were previously unavailable with EOAs. Essentially anything that can be programmed into a smart contract can be used by Smart Accounts.

*   **Automated Transactions:** Set up recurring payments or conditional transfers.
*   **Multi-Signature Authorization:** Require multiple approvals for a transaction to increase security.
*   **Delegated Transactions:** Allow a third party to execute transactions on your behalf under specific conditions.
*   **Enhanced Security:** Implement complex security mechanisms such as time-locked transactions and withdrawal limits.
*   **Interoperability:** Interact seamlessly with decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.
*   **Custom Logic:** Create custom transaction rules and workflows that align with personal or business requirements.

### How do I get a Smart Account?

Existing AppKit Universal Wallet Users will be given the option to upgrade their account to a smart account. Once you upgrade you will still be able to access your EOA and self-custody your account.

New AppKit Universal Wallet Users will be given smart accounts by default when they login for the first time.

### Does it cost anything?

There is a small additional cost for activating your smart account. The activation fee is added to the first transaction and covers the network fees required for deploying the new smart contract onchain.

### Can I export my Smart Account?

No, you cannot export your Smart Account. The Smart Account (SA) is deployed by the EOA and is owned by the EOA. Your EOA account will always be exportable. Also is good to know that SA don’t have seedphrases.

### Can I withdraw all my funds from my Smart Account?

Yes, you can withdraw all your funds from your Smart Account.

### What are account names?

Smart account addresses start with ’0x’ followed by 42 characters, this is the unique address of your smart account on the network. ‘0x’ addresses like this are long, unwieldy and unmemorable. AppKit allows you to assign a more memorable name for your smart account using [ENS Resolvers](https://docs.ens.domains/resolvers/ccip-read).

You can assign a name to your account and this will act as an alias for your account that can be shared publicly and provide a better user experience. AppKit account names are followed by the “reown.id” domain.

### What can I do with my account name?

As AppKit smart account addresses are the same across the supported networks by [Pimlico](https://docs.pimlico.io/infra/platform/supported-chains), you only need one account name which can then be used across the networks.

For example if you want someone to send you USDC on Polygon they can send it to “johnsmith.reown.id”. If you want someone wants to send you USDC on Optimism they can also use “johnsmith.reown.id”.</content>

  <title>Custom networks - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/core/custom-networks</url>
  <content>If you cannot find the network you are looking for within the `@reown/appkit/networks` path, you can always add a custom network.

Since AppKit v1.1.0, there are two ways to add your network to AppKit:

### 1\. Adding Your Chain to Viem’s Directory (Recommended)

Reown AppKit use Viem to provide EVM chains to users under the hood. If your chain is EVM-compatible, it is recommended to open a PR to Viem to add your network to Viem’s directory. Once your chain is accepted by Viem, it will automatically be available in AppKit with no additional steps required.

**Here is the documentation of how to add new chain to Viem:** [https://github.com/wevm/viem/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#chains](https://github.com/wevm/viem/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#chains)

### 2\. Creating a Custom Chain Object

You can also create a custom network object without waiting for approval from Viem’s repository.

**Required Information**

You will need the following values to create a custom network:

*   **id**: Chain ID of the network.
*   **name**: Name of the network.
*   **caipNetworkId**: CAIP-2 compliant network ID.
*   **chainNamespace**: Chain namespace.
*   **nativeCurrency**: Native currency of the network.
*   **rpcUrls**: Object containing the RPC URLs for the network.
*   **blockExplorers**: Object containing the block explorers for the network.</content>

  <title>Sign In With X - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/core/siwx</url>
  <content>Introduction
------------

The **Sign In With X** feature enables decentralized applications (Dapps) to authenticate users seamlessly across multiple blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, Polygon or Solana. This feature allows developers using our SDK to implement authentication by having users sign a unique string message with their blockchain wallets. The **Sign In With X** feature is designed in accordance with the [CAIP-122](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/main/CAIPs/caip-122.md) standard, which establishes a chain-agnostic framework for blockchain-based authentication and authorization on off-chain services.

  
[

Try Demo
--------



](https://appkit-lab.reown.com/library/siwx-default/)  

Getting Started
---------------

**SIWX** works as a plugin system for AppKit and you are going to add the plugin in the AppKit configuration. There are some ways to implement the **SIWX** feature:

*   Use the default implementation provided by AppKit
*   Use Cloud Auth SIWX to manage the sessions in the Cloud Dashboard
*   Create a custom implementation to suit your specific requirements.

To initialize the **SIWX** feature, you need to add the `siwx` parameter to the `createAppKit` function.

### Default Implementation

By using the default implementation, you can quickly integrate the **SIWX** feature into your Dapp. The default implementation provides a set of pre-built components that allow you to have the feature up and running in no time.

Read more about the [Default Implementation](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/core/siwx-default).

### Cloud Auth Implementation

The Cloud Auth SIWX is a predefined implementation of the SIWX configuration plugin that uses the Cloud service to create and manage SIWX messages and sessions. With Cloud Auth SIWX, you will be able to see and control the sessions of your users using the [User Management Dashboard](https://docs.reown.com/cloud/user-management).

Read more about the [Cloud Auth Implementation](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/core/siwx-cloud-auth).

### Custom Implementation

The `siwx` param expects to receive a defined interface from which you are able to create your own implementation. This is what allows you to customize the feature to suit your specific requirements.

The defined interface must follow specific rules to make sure that AppKit can interact with it correctly. Read more about how to have your [Custom Implementation](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/core/siwx-custom).

SIWX Expected Behavior
----------------------

*   **SIWX** will prompt to get the user signature and verify his identity every time a connection happen;
*   In case a SIWX session is already stored, the user will be automatically signed in and the prompt step will be skipped;
*   If the user changes the connected network, **SIWX** will prompt to get the user signature and verify his identity again;
*   If the user disconnects from the Dapp, **SIWX** will revoke the session and the user will need to sign in again.

Migrating from SIWE to SIWX
---------------------------

If you are currently already using **SIWE** from `@reown/appkit-siwe`, after AppKit version 1.5.0, you will be migrated into **SIWX**. The migration process is automatic and your `siweConfig` from `createAppKit` function will be mapped internally.</content>

  <title>Smart Sessions - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/early-access/smart-session</url>
  <content>Overview
--------

Smart Sessions allow developers to easily integrate session-based permission handling within their decentralized applications (dApps). Using the `grantPermissions` method, can send permission requests to wallets.

For users, this means a simpler experience. Instead of approving every action individually, they can allow access for a single session, making it faster and easier to use apps without dealing with constant pop-ups or interruptions.

With Smart Sessions, approved actions are carried out by the app’s backend during the session. This allows transactions to be processed automatically, making the experience even more seamless while ensuring that everything stays within the permissions set by the user.

This guide will walk you through on how to use the `grantPermissions` method, including the basic setup and an example of how to request permissions from a wallet.

Implementations
---------------

The `grantPermissions` method provides an easy way to interact with the smart wallet to request permissions.

### Step 1 | Install the library

### Step 2 | Import the method

First, import the grantPermissions method from the `@reown/appkit-experimental/smart-session` package.

### Step 3 | Define the Permission Request

Create an object adhering to the `SmartSessionGrantPermissionsRequest` type. This object specifies details like the `address`, `chainID`, `signer`, `policies`, `permissions`, and `expiry` time.

Example request object:

### Step 4 | Invoke the Method

Call the `grantPermissions` function, passing the request object. This will trigger the permission request via the connected wallet.

### Step 5 | Handle the Response

Upon successful execution, the response will include the granted permissions and the session context. So the response can be handled as needed.

#### Response Format

How to use the permissions
--------------------------

The dApp must call the following two endpoints from the wallet services API to use these permissions.

1.  `https://rpc.walletconnect.org/v1/wallets/prepareCalls` - Accepts an EIP-5792 `wallet_sendCalls` request. Responds with the prepared calls (in the case of Appkit Embedded Wallet, an Entrypoint v0.7 user operation), some context, and a signature request.
2.  `https://rpc.walletconnect.org/v1/wallets/sendPreparedCalls` - Accepts prepared calls, a signature, and the context returned from prepareCalls if present. Returns an EIP-5792 calls ID.

### Steps to follow for executing any async action by the dApp backend.

1.  Dapp makes the `wallet_prepareCalls` JSON RPC call to the wallet service API. Accepts an EIP-5792 `wallet_sendCalls` request, and returns the prepared calls according to the account’s implementation.
    
    #### Parameter
    

#### Return value

2.  App developers are expected to Sign the `signatureRequest.hash` returned from `wallet_prepareCalls` call using the dApp key (secp256k1 or secp256r1)
    
3.  dApps makes the `wallet_sendPreparedCalls` JSON RPC call to wallet service API. The RPC accepts the prepared response from `wallet_prepareCalls` request along with a signature, and returns an [EIP-5792](https://eip.tools/eip/5792) call bundle ID.

  <title>Sending with Cloud - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/notifications/cloud-sending</url>
  <content>You can send notifications to subscribed users easily in [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/). Sending to users involves targeting particular [notification types](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/notifications/cloud-setup#notification-types) who will receive your notification if they have not opted-out. You can specify a title and body for the notification, as well as a call-to-action link which users will be taken to when clicking on the notification.

Users can subscribe to your app in [several places](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/notifications/overview#subscribing-and-receiving-notifications) including the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/), in your app with our [frontend SDK](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/notifications/frontend-integration/usage), or in supporting wallets.

To send notifications, you can use the utility provided in [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/) under the Notify API section:

1.  In the APIs tab of your project, navigate to the Notify API section. You should see a banner with a link to the Send Notification playground.
    
2.  This allows you to send notifications to your subscribers. After you select the associated project, you can select the notification type, title, body, and link to send to your subscribers.</content>
</page>

<page>
  <title>Cloud Setup - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/notifications/cloud-setup</url>
  <content>This page explains the configuration required in order to obtain a Notify API Secret and configure your project to send notifications.

For a quick start to experiment with, you can try the [web3inbox template](https://github.com/WalletConnect/web3inbox-client/tree/main/apps/web) and following the steps in the README.

Domain to use
-------------

It is important to understand what domain you are using for your project as you are required to host a static file (the `did.json` file) on this domain before being able to use Notify API. The [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/) and clients receiving and managing your notifications use this file to authenticate that your domain is associated with the source of the notifications.

You can pick 1 domain and this is configured in the Dapp URL field of the Notify API section of the [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/). You may change your domain at any time, as long as you properly host the new `did.json` file there. Note that only one project may use a given domain at the same time.

During development it is optional to use your production domain for testing. Instead, you can use a staging domain, or even a entirely separate domain e.g. Vercel test site. However, once you move to production you will need to update your domain to your production domain and host a new file there.

Note that the file must be hosted on a real, publicly accessible, domain in order to verify its legitimacy. The use of `localhost` or other local addresses is not allowed.

Dapp name, description, and logo
--------------------------------

The dapp name, description, and logo are displayed in wallets that integrate Notify API as well as in the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/). These details should be provided for the best user experience and to help the user identify your app.

Notification types
------------------

Notification types are an important feature of Notify API and are a way for a user to have control over what types of notifications they receive. Users can change their notification types at any time in your app, their wallet, or the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/). When sending notifications, you must use one of these configured notification types which you reference in code by its UUID.

Notification types are configured with a name, description, and icon which allow the user understand what types of notifications they would receive for that type. When a user receives a push notification on their device, they will see the icon that is configured with the notification type. Examples of notification types may include “Account updates” or “Service updates”.

Setup steps
-----------

### Navigating to Notify API section

In [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/), navigate to the APIs tab of your project.

### Configuring Notify API

Under Notify API > Configuration > `DAPP INFORMATION`, fill in the Dapp URL field. This is the domain of your app that you will use to publish notifications.

### Adding Notification Image and Types

Under the same section, next to Notification types, click on the “Add Notification Type” button and add a title, notification image and description for your notification type. This is the type of notification that your app will publish.

For example, if you are going to send promotional content as notification, you might want to add a notification type called “Promotional” with a description “Promotional content from the XYZ Team.”. You can also add a relevant image for the notification type.

### Saving Changes

Optionally, you can add a logo and description for your project. This will be shown to users when they subscribe to your app. Click “Save” to save your changes.

### Notify Secret

Take note of your new Notify API Secret. You will need this to publish notifications. This secret allows publishing notifications to any account subscribed to your app, so should not be published and should only be used by your app backend.

### Hosting did.json file

Next, you will need to host `did.json` file on this page at the `/.well-known/` directory of your public URL. Please also ensure that your application has CORS enabled. An example is linked [here.](https://github.com/WalletConnect/gm-dapp/blob/main/next.config.js)

*   Download `did.json` (click on `DID:WEB` section to show the download button ) and host it at, for example, `https://app.example.com/.well-known/did.json`

### Enabling Welcome Notifications

Welcome Notifications are notifications that are sent to users when they subscribe to your app. This is a great way to welcome users to your app and explain what types of notifications they will receive.

To enable Welcome Notifications, switch on the toggle in the Welcome Notifications section of your Reown Cloud project after adding relevant Notification Type, Title, Body & Link.

### Enabling Notify API

Once all changes have been saved and the `did.json` file has been deployed successfully, switch on the toggle switch in the Notify API section of your Reown Cloud project. If everything is configured correctly, you should see a success toast: “Notify configuration successfully verified”

Send Notifications in Cloud
---------------------------

Once you have completed the setup steps, you can now send notifications to users who have subscribed to your app. [Read more](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/notifications/cloud-sending)

  <title>SIWX Default - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/authentication/siwx/siwx-default</url>
  <content>SIWX Default Usage
------------------

The Sign In With X feature enables decentralized applications (Dapps) to authenticate users seamlessly across multiple blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, Polygon or Solana. The user can connect and then sign a message with their account to prove ownership of the account.

Quick Start
-----------

Here is a quick guide to get started with the **SIWX** feature using the default implementation.

### Example

[

Next.js MultiChain SIWX Default Example
---------------------------------------

Check the Next.js example using DefaultSIWX in a multi-chain environment



](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit-web-examples/blob/main/nextjs/next-siwx-multichain/)

### Installation

### Usage

You should now have the **SIWX** feature up and running in your Dapp.

The `DefaultSIWX` configuration will use the predefined components to handle the message generation, verification and storage of the sessions. You can customize the default implementation by providing your own components as in the following sections.

Customizing the Default Implementation
--------------------------------------

The default implementation of **SIWX** is divided in three main components: `SIWXMessenger`, `SIWXVerifier` and `SIWXStorage`. The `@reown/appkit-siwx` package have defined options to fulfill the parts when initializing the `DefaultSIWX` configuration and you are also able to setup your own parts as required.

### Predefined Components

The `@reown/appkit-siwx` package provides some predefined components that you can use to quickly setup the `DefaultSIWX` configuration.

Check the latest components over the [SIWX repository](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/tree/main/packages/siwx)

#### Customizing components

You may provide the parts to the `DefaultSIWX` configuration using the predefined components exposed by `@reown/appkit-siwx` package and customize the component params as needed.

### Custom Components

You may create your own components to handle the message generation, verification and storage of the sessions. The following sections will guide you through the process of creating your own components.

#### `SIWXMessenger`

The [`SIWXMessenger`](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/blob/main/packages/siwx/src/core/SIWXMessenger.ts) is an abstract class which holds methods for generating the message to be signed.

##### Creating a Custom Messenger:

You may extend the `SIWXMessenger` class adding the public attributes:

*   `version`: a string that represents the version of the messenger;
*   `stringify`: a method that receives the message data and returns a string to be signed.

#### `SIWXVerifier`

The [`SIWXVerifier`](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/blob/main/packages/siwx/src/core/SIWXVerifier.ts) is an abstract class that defines the verification logic for the signed message.

##### Creating a Custom Verifier:

You may extend the `SIWXVerifier` class adding the public attributes:

*   `chainNamespace`: a string that represents the chain namespace for the verifier;
*   `verify`: a method that receives the session data and returns a boolean indicating if the session is valid.

#### `SIWXStorage`

[

Next.js SIWX Default Example with supabase storage
--------------------------------------------------

Check the Next.js example using DefaultSIWX and supabase as default storage



](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit-web-examples/tree/main/nextjs/next-siwx-multichain-supabase-storage)

[`SIWXStorage`](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/blob/main/packages/siwx/src/core/SIWXStorage.ts) is a interface that defines how the session data will be stored.

##### Creating a Custom Storage:

You may implement the `SIWXStorage` interface with the following methods:

*   `add`: This method will be called to store a new single session that is verified;
*   `set`: This method must replace all the sessions in the storage with the new ones;
*   `get`: This method must return all the sessions stored for a specific chain and address. Is expected that the sessions are already verified;
*   `delete`: This method must delete all the sessions stored for a specific chain and address.

#### Using custom components

You may provide your custom components to the `DefaultSIWX` configuration.

If you omit any of the components, the default implementation will be used. Check [here](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/blob/main/packages/siwx/src/configs/DefaultSIWX.ts) the default components.</content>

  <title>Backend Integration - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/notifications/backend-integration</url>
  <content>Once an account is subscribed to your app’s notifications you can test sending notifications to the account. You can subscribe in your app directly with our [Frontend Integration](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/notifications/frontend-integration/usage), or with one of the below testing options.

We recommend testing notifications with the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/) which supports push notifications and can be installed to your phone. You can also try one of our sample wallets:

*   [iOS sample wallet](https://testflight.apple.com/join/09bTAryp)
*   [Android sample wallet](https://appdistribution.firebase.dev/i/d2c86e879abd5a86)

Authentication
--------------

To send notifications and access all subscriber information for your dapp, you will need your Notify API Secret and project ID.

You can find the Notify API Secret under the Notify API section of the APIs tab of your project on [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/). Follow steps on the [Cloud Setup](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/notifications/cloud-setup) page to configure this. This secret allows publishing notifications to any account subscribed to your app, so should not be published and should only be used by your app backend.

Sending notifications
---------------------

Only plaintext is supported, and newlines are ignored.

To send a notification notification you can call the `/notify` endpoint. This endpoint supports the following fields:

*   `type` - The Notification type ID copied from Reown Cloud.
*   `title` - The title of the notification. Max 64 characters.
*   `body` - The body of the notification containing more detail. Max 255 characters.
*   `url` (optional) - A URL attached to the notification that the user can navigate to. Max 255 characters.
*   `accounts` - A list of [CAIP-10](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/main/CAIPs/caip-10.md) account IDs for which to send the notification to. Max 500 accounts per request. Also see the [rate limits](https://docs.reown.com/_sites/docs.reown.com/appkit/react/notifications/backend-integration#rate-limits) below.
*   `notification_id` (optional) - An idempotency key of arbitrary format used to dedup multiple requests. Max 255 characters. Multiple calls with the same `notification_id` will use the first call’s `notification` content, but will send to any additional account IDs listed in `accounts`.

Example usage:

Get subscribers
---------------

You can tell if an account is subscribed and get information about subscribers using the `/v1/<project-id>/subscribers` endpoint. You can provide up to 100 accounts in the request.

If the account is subscribed, it will be returned as a key in the response along with a list of subscribed notification types as the value. If the account is not a subscriber, it will not be returned in the response.

Example usage:

Example response:

Get all subscribers
-------------------

You can get a list of all of the currently-subscribed accounts by calling the `/<project-id>/subscribers` endpoint.

Example usage:

Mark all notifications as read
------------------------------

Unless marked as read by an app frontend, notifications will always be “unread”. Because of this, when you initially add support for displaying unread status or unread count to your frontend, users that have received notifications in the past will have notifications display as “unread” even if they already have seen them. This can potentially be an undesirable user experience.

To mitigate this problem, you can make a one-time call to the `/v1/<project-id>/mark-all-as-read` API endpoint which will mark all existing notifications as read. Notifications marked as read in this way will not contribute to read rate analytics. After you deploy your integration of unread states, you can call this endpoint to reset the unread state for all of your existing notifications.

Rate limits
-----------

To protect our system and subscribers, various limits and rate limits are in-place.

Rate limits are implemented as [token bucket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket) and contain both rate and burst amounts. On average, a rate of requests can be made. However, since real-world applications often make requests in bursts, this fixed rate can be surpassed temporarily up to the burst amount, provided the app subsequently makes requests below the average in order to recover its bursting capability.

*   `POST /<project-id>/notify`:
    *   Each app can send 2 notifications per hour to an account, with a burst up to 50. Accounts that have been rate limited will be returned in the request response. Exceptions may be made on a per-project basis for special circumstances.
    *   Each app can call this endpoint 2 times per second with a burst up to 20. Rate limited requests will return a 429 status code.
*   `POST /v1/<project-id>/subscribers`
    *   Each app can call this endpoint 100 times per second with a burst up to 100. Rate limited requests will return a 429 status code.
*   `GET /<project-id>/subscribers`
    *   Each app can call this endpoint 1 time every 5 minutes with a burst up to 2. Rate limited requests will return a 429 status code.
*   `POST /v1/<project-id>/mark-all-as-read`
    *   Each app can call this endpoint 1 time per hour with a burst up to 5. Rate limited requests will return a 429 status code.</content>

  <content>Try AppKit Notifications
------------------------

The fastest way to try AppKit Notifications is to go to [app.web3inbox.com](https://app.web3inbox.com/) and try subscribing to some dapps. The [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/) is a universal inbox for web3 users to access all their notifications in one place.

*   [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/)

Or access the repo at [github.com/WalletConnect/web3inbox](https://github.com/WalletConnect/web3inbox/).

Native notifications
--------------------

AppKit Notifications also supports native notifications on iOS and Android. To try native notifications, you can use the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/) and subscribe to dapps or build one of our sample apps.

A wallet that supports Notify is required to receive notifications.

Wallet notifications
--------------------

To try wallet notifications on a iOS or Android device, use a wallet that supports Notify. Alternatively, try building one of our sample apps, or grab a sample wallet preview build from Testflight or Firebase.

  <title>SIWX Custom - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/authentication/siwx/siwx-custom</url>
  <content>SIWX Custom Usage
-----------------

Alternatively from the [Default Implementation](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/authentication/siwx/siwx-default), you can create your own implementation of the **SIWX** feature to suit your specific requirements.

**SIWX** is developed to work as a plugin system for AppKit and to enable correctly it you need to fulfill the expected interface within the `createAppKit` function.

SIWXConfig interface
--------------------

This is the interface that you need to implement to create your own **SIWX** feature.

All the typings used are exposed by `@reown/appkit-core` package. You may check the source code [here](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/blob/main/packages/core/src/utils/SIWXUtil.ts).

Constraints
-----------

You are able to implement the `SIWXConfig` in the way you would like, but some constraints MUST be followed to make sure that AppKit can interact with it correctly and it will work as expected:

### `createMessage`

This method will be called to create a new message to be signed by the user.

*   The message MUST be unique and contain all the necessary information to verify the user’s identity.

### `addSession`

This method will be called to store a new single session.

*   This method MUST verify if the session is valid and store it in the storage successfully.

### `revokeSession`

This method will be called to revoke all the sessions stored for a specific chain and address.

*   This method MUST delete all the sessions stored for the specific chain and address successfully.

### `setSessions`

This method will be called to replace all the sessions in the storage with the new ones.

*   This method MUST verify all the sessions before storing them in the storage;
*   This method MUST replace all the sessions in the storage with the new ones successfully otherwise it MUST throw an error.

### `getSessions`

This method will be called to get all the sessions stored for a specific chain and address.

*   This method MUST return only sessions that are verified and valid;
*   This method MUST NOT return expired sessions.

  <title>Verify - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/cloud/verify</url>
  <content>Verify API is a security-focused feature that allows wallets to notify end-users when they may be connecting to a suspicious or malicious domain, helping to prevent phishing attacks across the industry.

Once a wallet knows whether an end-user is on uniswap.com or eviluniswap.com, it can help them to detect potentially harmful connections through Verify’s combined offering of Reown’s domain registry.

Cloud Verification
------------------

In order to verify your app domain in Reown Cloud follow these steps:

1.  Head over to [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/)
    
2.  Create a new project or click on the project you would like to verify.
    
3.  On the settings tab, head over to the ‘Domain verification’ section and fill in the website URL that you wish to verify.
    

4.  Click on the copy button and head over to your domain Name Registrar/Provider to edit your DNS records. Alternatively, if you can’t manage DNS records for your project (eg: ENS or vercel.app) you can host a static file under `/.well-known/walletconnect.txt` which contains the entire verification code that you copied. If you are using the static file method, you can jump over step 7.
    
5.  Under `Type`, select `TXT`. In the “Answer” section, paste the text you copied from the cloud dashboard. This field may vary across DNS dashboards. If you’re trying to register a subdomain, add it under `Host`. Feel free to leave TTL at its default value.
    

6.  Depending on your DNS settings, this might take a while to reflect. You can check out DNS settings for your website with CLI tools like Dig or with websites like [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=txt)
    
7.  Once this is done and you have confirmed this change is reflected, head on back to your Cloud Dashboard and click on Verify.
    

8.  You should see a toast pop up in the bottom right section of your screen and the domain verification section should have a green tick next to it.</content>

  <title>Relay - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/cloud/relay</url>
  <content>Project ID
----------

The Project ID is consumed through URL parameters.

URL parameters used:

*   `projectId`: Your Project ID can be obtained from [cloud.reown.com](https://cloud.reown.com/)

Example URL:

`https://relay.walletconnect.com/?projectId=c4f79cc821944d9680842e34466bfbd`

This can be instantiated from the client with the `projectId` in the `SignClient` constructor.

Allowlist
---------

To help prevent malicious use of your project ID you are strongly encouraged to set an allowlist of [origins](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin) or application/bundle ids for mobile applications where the project ID is used. Requests from other origins will be denied.

*   Allowlist supports a list of origins in the format `[scheme://]<hostname[:port]`.
*   [Application ID](https://developer.android.com/build/configure-app-module#set-application-id)/[Bundle IDs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/bundle_ids) typically are defined using the [reverse domain name notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation)

Using `localhost` (or `127.0.0.1`) is always permitted, and if empty all origins are allowed. Updates take 15 minutes to apply.

If scheme or port is specified, it must match exactly. Hostname must also match exactly, but wildcards can be used for individual labels within the hostname.

Example of possible origins in the allowlist:

*   `example.com` - allows `https://example.com` or `http://example.com` but not `https://www.example.com`
*   `https://example.com` - allows `https://example.com` but not `http://example.com`
*   `https://www.example.com` - allows `https://www.example.com` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://example.com:8080` - allows `https://example.com:8080` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://*.example.com` - allows `https://www.example.com` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://*.*.example.com` - allows `https://www.subdomain.example.com` but not `https://www.example.com` or `https://example.com`
*   `https://www.*.example.com` - allows `https://www.subdomain.example.com` but not `https://www.example.com`
*   `https://www-*.example.com` - invalid; `*` must be the full label

Error Codes
-----------

| Reason | Error Code |
| --- | --- |
| Project ID doesn’t exist OR JWT is expired | 401 |
| Exists and is invalid | 403 |
| Too many requests | 1013 |

Websocket Close Codes
---------------------

| Code | Description | Reconnect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1001 | Server terminating | Yes |
| 4008 | Client stale: connected without a prior subscription and is not sending data | When needed |
| 4010 | Load Rebalancing | Yes |

Best Practices
--------------

*   Create a new `projectId` for each project. This allows for more granular control, dedicated explorer listings, and project metrics.
*   Don’t reuse a `projectId`.
*   Use the AllowList to limit unauthorized usage.
*   Avoid committing projects keys to the repo. Use env variables instead.

  <title>Chain Abstraction - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/early-access/chain-abstraction</url>
  <content>Overview
--------

Chain abstraction simplifies interactions across different blockchains, allowing users to transact seamlessly without worrying about network-specific tokens.

To fully leverage chain abstraction, wallets need to support its implementation, and minor adjustments are required on the Dapp side.

Dapps may not always be aware of the balances across different chains or accounts that wallets can access. Therefore, it’s crucial to ensure that the call does not fail on the Dapp side.

This guide focuses on the most common ways Dapps interact with wallets using the Wagmi library.

Implementations
---------------

### useSendTransaction

The `useSendTransaction` hook attempts to estimate gas on the Dapp side before forwarding the call to the wallet. However, gas estimation might fail because the Dapp may not account for all the funds available to the wallet across different chains.

To ensure the call is sent successfully, the wallet must handle gas estimation. You need to pass `gas: null` to the sendTransaction method.

  <title>Smart Accounts - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/vue/core/smart-accounts</url>
  <content>Overview
--------

Smart Accounts (SAs) are enabled by default within AppKit. These accounts enhance functionality by emitting 1271 and 6492 signatures, which should be taken into account for signature verification processes, such as Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE).

### Deployment

Smart Accounts are deployed alongside the first transaction. Until deployment, a precalculated address, known as the counterfactual address, is displayed. Despite not being deployed, the account can still sign using 6492 signatures.

### Supported Networks

Smart Accounts are available on the following networks:

*   Base Sepolia
*   BSC (Binance Smart Chain)
*   Fraximal
*   Linea
*   Mode
*   Optimism
*   Polygon
*   Polygon Mumbai
*   Sepolia

### User Eligibility

Smart Accounts are exclusively available for embedded wallet users (email and social login)

FAQ
---

### What is a Smart Account?

A Smart Account improves the traditional account experience by replacing Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) with a Smart Contract that follows the [ERC-4337 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337). This opens up many use cases that were previously unavailable.

Smart Accounts do no require Private Keys or Seed Phrases, instead they rely on a key or multiple keys from designated signers to access the smart account and perform actions on chain. The keys can take multiple forms including passkeys and EOA signatures.

### What can I do with a Smart Account?

Smart accounts unlock a host of use cases that were previously unavailable with EOAs. Essentially anything that can be programmed into a smart contract can be used by Smart Accounts.

*   **Automated Transactions:** Set up recurring payments or conditional transfers.
*   **Multi-Signature Authorization:** Require multiple approvals for a transaction to increase security.
*   **Delegated Transactions:** Allow a third party to execute transactions on your behalf under specific conditions.
*   **Enhanced Security:** Implement complex security mechanisms such as time-locked transactions and withdrawal limits.
*   **Interoperability:** Interact seamlessly with decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.
*   **Custom Logic:** Create custom transaction rules and workflows that align with personal or business requirements.

### How do I get a Smart Account?

Existing AppKit Universal Wallet Users will be given the option to upgrade their account to a smart account. Once you upgrade you will still be able to access your EOA and self-custody your account.

New AppKit Universal Wallet Users will be given smart accounts by default when they login for the first time.

### Does it cost anything?

There is a small additional cost for activating your smart account. The activation fee is added to the first transaction and covers the network fees required for deploying the new smart contract onchain.

### Can I export my Smart Account?

No, you cannot export your Smart Account. The Smart Account (SA) is deployed by the EOA and is owned by the EOA. Your EOA account will always be exportable. Also is good to know that SA don’t have seedphrases.

### Can I withdraw all my funds from my Smart Account?

Yes, you can withdraw all your funds from your Smart Account.

### What are account names?

Smart account addresses start with ’0x’ followed by 42 characters, this is the unique address of your smart account on the network. ‘0x’ addresses like this are long, unwieldy and unmemorable. AppKit allows you to assign a more memorable name for your smart account using [ENS Resolvers](https://docs.ens.domains/resolvers/ccip-read).

You can assign a name to your account and this will act as an alias for your account that can be shared publicly and provide a better user experience. AppKit account names are followed by the “reown.id” domain.

### What can I do with my account name?

As AppKit smart account addresses are the same across the supported networks by [Pimlico](https://docs.pimlico.io/infra/platform/supported-chains), you only need one account name which can then be used across the networks.

For example if you want someone to send you USDC on Polygon they can send it to “johnsmith.reown.id”. If you want someone wants to send you USDC on Optimism they can also use “johnsmith.reown.id”.</content>

  <title>Custom connectors - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/vue/core/custom-connectors</url>
  <content>If you already have Wagmi integrated into your application or would like more control over Wagmi’s configuration, you can integrate AppKit on top of it.

Adding custom connectors like WalletConnect and Coinbase is optional.

By default, [EIP-6963](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963) and WC connectors are provided out of the box.

    import { createAppKit } from '@reown/appkit/vue'
    import { WagmiAdapter } from '@reown/appkit-adapter-wagmi'
    
    import { http, WagmiProvider, CreateConnectorFn } from 'wagmi'
    import { sepolia } from '@reown/appkit/networks'
    import { walletConnect, coinbaseWallet, injected } from 'wagmi/connectors'
    
    const projectId = 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID'
    
    const metadata = {
      //....
    }
    
    // create the connectors (delete the ones you don't need)
    const connectors: CreateConnectorFn[] = []
    connectors.push(walletConnect({ projectId, metadata, showQrModal: false })) // showQrModal must be false
    connectors.push(injected({ shimDisconnect: true }))
    connectors.push(
      coinbaseWallet({
        appName: metadata.name,
        appLogoUrl: metadata.icons[0]
      })
    )
    
    const export networks = [sepolia]
    
    export const wagmiAdapter = new WagmiAdapter({
      transports: {
        [sepolia.id]: http()
      },
      connectors,
      projectId,
      networks
    })
    
    export const config = wagmiAdapter.wagmiConfig
    
    createAppKit({
      adapters: [wagmiAdapter],
      projectId,
      networks: [sepolia]
    })
    

Add custom wallet adapters for Solana wallets by first installing the wallet adapter package and then including the adapters in the wallets array. You can find a more Solana wallet adapters [here](https://github.com/anza-xyz/wallet-adapter/tree/master/packages/wallets).

    npm install @solana/wallet-adapter-wallets
    

    import { createAppKit } from "@reown/appkit/vue";
    import { SolanaAdapter } from "@reown/appkit-adapter-solana/vue";
    import { solana, solanaTestnet, solanaDevnet } from "@reown/appkit/networks";
    
    import {
      SolflareWalletAdapter,
      PhantomWalletAdapter,
    } from "@solana/wallet-adapter-wallets";
    
    // 0. Set up Solana adapter
    const solanaWeb3JsAdapter = new SolanaAdapter({
      wallets: [new PhantomWalletAdapter(), new SolflareWalletAdapter()],
    });
    
    // 1. Get projectId from https://cloud.reown.com
    const projectId = "YOUR_PROJECT_ID";
    
    // 2. Set up the metadata
    const metadata = {
      //...
    };
    
    // 3. Create the modal
    const modal = createAppKit({
      adapters: [solanaWeb3JsAdapter],
      networks: [solana, solanaTestnet, solanaDevnet],
      metadata: metadata,
      projectId,
      features: {
        analytics: true,
      },
    });</content>

  <title>Custom networks - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/vue/core/custom-networks</url>
  <content>If you cannot find the network you are looking for within the `@reown/appkit/networks` path, you can always add a custom network.

Since AppKit v1.1.0, there are two ways to add your network to AppKit:

### 1\. Adding Your Chain to Viem’s Directory (Recommended)

Reown AppKit use Viem to provide EVM chains to users under the hood. If your chain is EVM-compatible, it is recommended to open a PR to Viem to add your network to Viem’s directory. Once your chain is accepted by Viem, it will automatically be available in AppKit with no additional steps required.

**Here is the documentation of how to add new chain to Viem:** [https://github.com/wevm/viem/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#chains](https://github.com/wevm/viem/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#chains)

### 2\. Creating a Custom Chain Object

You can also create a custom network object without waiting for approval from Viem’s repository.

**Required Information**

You will need the following values to create a custom network:

*   **id**: Chain ID of the network.
*   **name**: Name of the network.
*   **caipNetworkId**: CAIP-2 compliant network ID.
*   **chainNamespace**: Chain namespace.
*   **nativeCurrency**: Native currency of the network.
*   **rpcUrls**: Object containing the RPC URLs for the network.
*   **blockExplorers**: Object containing the block explorers for the network.</content>

*   [**Wormfare**](https://dashboard.wormfare.com/purchase)

ThemeMode
---------

By default `themeMode` option will be set to user system settings ‘light’ or ‘dark’. But you can override it like this:

themeVariables
--------------

By default `themeVariables` are undefined. You can set them like this:

The following list shows the theme variables you can override:

| Variable | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--w3m-font-family` | Base font family | `string` |
| `--w3m-accent` | Color used for buttons, icons, labels, etc. | `string` |
| `--w3m-color-mix` | The color that blends in with the default colors | `string` |
| `--w3m-color-mix-strength` | The percentage on how much “—w3m-color-mix” should blend in | `number` |
| `--w3m-font-size-master` | The base pixel size for fonts. | `string` |
| `--w3m-border-radius-master` | The base border radius in pixels. | `string` |

  <title>SIWX - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/vue/core/siwx</url>
  <content>Sign In With X
--------------

Introduction
------------

The **Sign In With X** feature enables decentralized applications (Dapps) to authenticate users seamlessly across multiple blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, Polygon or Solana. This feature allows developers using our SDK to implement authentication by having users sign a unique string message with their blockchain wallets. The **Sign In With X** feature is designed in accordance with the [CAIP-122](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/main/CAIPs/caip-122.md) standard, which establishes a chain-agnostic framework for blockchain-based authentication and authorization on off-chain services.

  
[

Try Demo
--------



](https://appkit-lab.reown.com/library/siwx-default/)  

Getting Started
---------------

**SIWX** works as a plugin system for AppKit and you are going to add the plugin in the AppKit configuration. There are some ways to implement the **SIWX** feature:

*   Use the default implementation provided by AppKit
*   Use Cloud Auth SIWX to manage the sessions in the Cloud Dashboard
*   Create a custom implementation to suit your specific requirements.

To initialize the **SIWX** feature, you need to add the `siwx` parameter to the `createAppKit` function.

### Default Implementation

By using the default implementation, you can quickly integrate the **SIWX** feature into your Dapp. The default implementation provides a set of pre-built components that allow you to have the feature up and running in no time.

Read more about the [Default Implementation](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/vue/core/siwx-default).

### Cloud Auth Implementation

The Cloud Auth SIWX is a predefined implementation of the SIWX configuration plugin that uses the Cloud service to create and manage SIWX messages and sessions. With Cloud Auth SIWX, you will be able to see and control the sessions of your users using the [User Management Dashboard](https://docs.reown.com/cloud/user-management).

Read more about the [Cloud Auth Implementation](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/vue/core/siwx-cloud-auth).

### Custom Implementation

The `siwx` param expects to receive a defined interface from which you are able to create your own implementation. This is what allows you to customize the feature to suit your specific requirements.

The defined interface must follow specific rules to make sure that AppKit can interact with it correctly. Read more about how to have your [Custom Implementation](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/vue/core/siwx-custom).

SIWX Expected Behavior

*   **SIWX** will prompt to get the user signature and verify his identity every time a connection happen;
*   In case a SIWX session is already stored, the user will be automatically signed in and the prompt step will be skipped;
*   If the user changes the connected network, **SIWX** will prompt to get the user signature and verify his identity again;
*   If the user disconnects from the Dapp, **SIWX** will revoke the session and the user will need to sign in again.

Migrating from SIWE to SIWX
---------------------------

If you are currently already using **SIWE** from `@reown/appkit-siwe`, after AppKit version 1.5.0, you will be migrated into **SIWX**. The migration process is automatic and your `siweConfig` from `createAppKit` function will be mapped internally.</content>

  <title>Smart Sessions - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/vue/early-access/smart-session</url>
  <content>Overview
--------

Smart Sessions allow developers to easily integrate session-based permission handling within their decentralized applications (dApps). Using the `grantPermissions` method, can send permission requests to wallets.

For users, this means a simpler experience. Instead of approving every action individually, they can allow access for a single session, making it faster and easier to use apps without dealing with constant pop-ups or interruptions.

With Smart Sessions, approved actions are carried out by the app’s backend during the session. This allows transactions to be processed automatically, making the experience even more seamless while ensuring that everything stays within the permissions set by the user.

This guide will walk you through on how to use the `grantPermissions` method, including the basic setup and an example of how to request permissions from a wallet.

Implementations
---------------

The `grantPermissions` method provides an easy way to interact with the smart wallet to request permissions.

### Step 1 | Install the library

### Step 2 | Import the method

First, import the grantPermissions method from the `@reown/appkit-experimental/smart-session` package.

### Step 3 | Define the Permission Request

Create an object adhering to the `SmartSessionGrantPermissionsRequest` type. This object specifies details like the `address`, `chainID`, `signer`, `policies`, `permissions`, and `expiry` time.

Example request object:

### Step 4 | Invoke the Method

Call the `grantPermissions` function, passing the request object. This will trigger the permission request via the connected wallet.

### Step 5 | Handle the Response

Upon successful execution, the response will include the granted permissions and the session context. So the response can be handled as needed.

#### Response Format

How to use the permissions
--------------------------

The dApp must call the following two endpoints from the wallet services API to use these permissions.

1.  `https://rpc.walletconnect.org/v1/wallets/prepareCalls` - Accepts an EIP-5792 `wallet_sendCalls` request. Responds with the prepared calls (in the case of Appkit Embedded Wallet, an Entrypoint v0.7 user operation), some context, and a signature request.
2.  `https://rpc.walletconnect.org/v1/wallets/sendPreparedCalls` - Accepts prepared calls, a signature, and the context returned from prepareCalls if present. Returns an EIP-5792 calls ID.

### Steps to follow for executing any async action by the dApp backend.

1.  Dapp makes the `wallet_prepareCalls` JSON RPC call to the wallet service API. Accepts an EIP-5792 `wallet_sendCalls` request, and returns the prepared calls according to the account’s implementation.
    
    #### Parameter
    

#### Return value

2.  App developers are expected to Sign the `signatureRequest.hash` returned from `wallet_prepareCalls` call using the dApp key (secp256k1 or secp256r1)
    
3.  dApps makes the `wallet_sendPreparedCalls` JSON RPC call to wallet service API. The RPC accepts the prepared response from `wallet_prepareCalls` request along with a signature, and returns an [EIP-5792](https://eip.tools/eip/5792) call bundle ID.

<page>
  <title>Sending with Cloud - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/vue/notifications/cloud-sending</url>
  <content>You can send notifications to subscribed users easily in [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/). Sending to users involves targeting particular [notification types](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/vue/notifications/cloud-setup#notification-types) who will receive your notification if they have not opted-out. You can specify a title and body for the notification, as well as a call-to-action link which users will be taken to when clicking on the notification.

Users can subscribe to your app in [several places](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/vue/notifications/overview#subscribing-and-receiving-notifications) including the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/), in your app with our [frontend SDK](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/vue/notifications/frontend-integration/usage), or in supporting wallets.

To send notifications, you can use the utility provided in [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/) under the Notify API section:

1.  In the APIs tab of your project, navigate to the Notify API section. You should see a banner with a link to the Send Notification playground.
    
2.  This allows you to send notifications to your subscribers. After you select the associated project, you can select the notification type, title, body, and link to send to your subscribers.</content>
</page>

<page>
  <title>Backend Integration - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/vue/notifications/backend-integration</url>
  <content>Once an account is subscribed to your app’s notifications you can test sending notifications to the account. You can subscribe in your app directly with our [Frontend Integration](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/vue/notifications/frontend-integration/usage), or with one of the below testing options.

We recommend testing notifications with the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/) which supports push notifications and can be installed to your phone. You can also try one of our sample wallets:

*   [iOS sample wallet](https://testflight.apple.com/join/09bTAryp)
*   [Android sample wallet](https://appdistribution.firebase.dev/i/d2c86e879abd5a86)

Authentication
--------------

To send notifications and access all subscriber information for your dapp, you will need your Notify API Secret and project ID.

You can find the Notify API Secret under the Notify API section of the APIs tab of your project on [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/). Follow steps on the [Cloud Setup](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/vue/notifications/cloud-setup) page to configure this. This secret allows publishing notifications to any account subscribed to your app, so should not be published and should only be used by your app backend.

Sending notifications
---------------------

Only plaintext is supported, and newlines are ignored.

To send a notification notification you can call the `/notify` endpoint. This endpoint supports the following fields:

*   `type` - The Notification type ID copied from Reown Cloud.
*   `title` - The title of the notification. Max 64 characters.
*   `body` - The body of the notification containing more detail. Max 255 characters.
*   `url` (optional) - A URL attached to the notification that the user can navigate to. Max 255 characters.
*   `accounts` - A list of [CAIP-10](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/main/CAIPs/caip-10.md) account IDs for which to send the notification to. Max 500 accounts per request. Also see the [rate limits](https://docs.reown.com/_sites/docs.reown.com/appkit/vue/notifications/backend-integration#rate-limits) below.
*   `notification_id` (optional) - An idempotency key of arbitrary format used to dedup multiple requests. Max 255 characters. Multiple calls with the same `notification_id` will use the first call’s `notification` content, but will send to any additional account IDs listed in `accounts`.

Example usage:

Get subscribers
---------------

You can tell if an account is subscribed and get information about subscribers using the `/v1/<project-id>/subscribers` endpoint. You can provide up to 100 accounts in the request.

If the account is subscribed, it will be returned as a key in the response along with a list of subscribed notification types as the value. If the account is not a subscriber, it will not be returned in the response.

Example usage:

Example response:

Get all subscribers
-------------------

You can get a list of all of the currently-subscribed accounts by calling the `/<project-id>/subscribers` endpoint.

Example usage:

Mark all notifications as read
------------------------------

Unless marked as read by an app frontend, notifications will always be “unread”. Because of this, when you initially add support for displaying unread status or unread count to your frontend, users that have received notifications in the past will have notifications display as “unread” even if they already have seen them. This can potentially be an undesirable user experience.

To mitigate this problem, you can make a one-time call to the `/v1/<project-id>/mark-all-as-read` API endpoint which will mark all existing notifications as read. Notifications marked as read in this way will not contribute to read rate analytics. After you deploy your integration of unread states, you can call this endpoint to reset the unread state for all of your existing notifications.

Rate limits
-----------

To protect our system and subscribers, various limits and rate limits are in-place.

Rate limits are implemented as [token bucket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket) and contain both rate and burst amounts. On average, a rate of requests can be made. However, since real-world applications often make requests in bursts, this fixed rate can be surpassed temporarily up to the burst amount, provided the app subsequently makes requests below the average in order to recover its bursting capability.

*   `POST /<project-id>/notify`:
    *   Each app can send 2 notifications per hour to an account, with a burst up to 50. Accounts that have been rate limited will be returned in the request response. Exceptions may be made on a per-project basis for special circumstances.
    *   Each app can call this endpoint 2 times per second with a burst up to 20. Rate limited requests will return a 429 status code.
*   `POST /v1/<project-id>/subscribers`
    *   Each app can call this endpoint 100 times per second with a burst up to 100. Rate limited requests will return a 429 status code.
*   `GET /<project-id>/subscribers`
    *   Each app can call this endpoint 1 time every 5 minutes with a burst up to 2. Rate limited requests will return a 429 status code.
*   `POST /v1/<project-id>/mark-all-as-read`
    *   Each app can call this endpoint 1 time per hour with a burst up to 5. Rate limited requests will return a 429 status code.</content>

<page>
  <title>Cloud Setup - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/vue/notifications/cloud-setup</url>
  <content>This page explains the configuration required in order to obtain a Notify API Secret and configure your project to send notifications.

For a quick start to experiment with, you can try the [web3inbox template](https://github.com/WalletConnect/web3inbox-client/tree/main/apps/web) and following the steps in the README.

Domain to use
-------------

It is important to understand what domain you are using for your project as you are required to host a static file (the `did.json` file) on this domain before being able to use Notify API. The [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/) and clients receiving and managing your notifications use this file to authenticate that your domain is associated with the source of the notifications.

You can pick 1 domain and this is configured in the Dapp URL field of the Notify API section of the [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/). You may change your domain at any time, as long as you properly host the new `did.json` file there. Note that only one project may use a given domain at the same time.

During development it is optional to use your production domain for testing. Instead, you can use a staging domain, or even a entirely separate domain e.g. Vercel test site. However, once you move to production you will need to update your domain to your production domain and host a new file there.

Note that the file must be hosted on a real, publicly accessible, domain in order to verify its legitimacy. The use of `localhost` or other local addresses is not allowed.

Dapp name, description, and logo
--------------------------------

The dapp name, description, and logo are displayed in wallets that integrate Notify API as well as in the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/). These details should be provided for the best user experience and to help the user identify your app.

Notification types
------------------

Notification types are an important feature of Notify API and are a way for a user to have control over what types of notifications they receive. Users can change their notification types at any time in your app, their wallet, or the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/). When sending notifications, you must use one of these configured notification types which you reference in code by its UUID.

Notification types are configured with a name, description, and icon which allow the user understand what types of notifications they would receive for that type. When a user receives a push notification on their device, they will see the icon that is configured with the notification type. Examples of notification types may include “Account updates” or “Service updates”.

Setup steps
-----------

### Navigating to Notify API section

In [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/), navigate to the APIs tab of your project.

### Configuring Notify API

Under Notify API > Configuration > `DAPP INFORMATION`, fill in the Dapp URL field. This is the domain of your app that you will use to publish notifications.

### Adding Notification Image and Types

Under the same section, next to Notification types, click on the “Add Notification Type” button and add a title, notification image and description for your notification type. This is the type of notification that your app will publish.

For example, if you are going to send promotional content as notification, you might want to add a notification type called “Promotional” with a description “Promotional content from the XYZ Team.”. You can also add a relevant image for the notification type.

### Saving Changes

Optionally, you can add a logo and description for your project. This will be shown to users when they subscribe to your app. Click “Save” to save your changes.

### Notify Secret

Take note of your new Notify API Secret. You will need this to publish notifications. This secret allows publishing notifications to any account subscribed to your app, so should not be published and should only be used by your app backend.

### Hosting did.json file

Next, you will need to host `did.json` file on this page at the `/.well-known/` directory of your public URL. Please also ensure that your application has CORS enabled. An example is linked [here.](https://github.com/WalletConnect/gm-dapp/blob/main/next.config.js)

*   Download `did.json` (click on `DID:WEB` section to show the download button ) and host it at, for example, `https://app.example.com/.well-known/did.json`
    

### Enabling Welcome Notifications

Welcome Notifications are notifications that are sent to users when they subscribe to your app. This is a great way to welcome users to your app and explain what types of notifications they will receive.

To enable Welcome Notifications, switch on the toggle in the Welcome Notifications section of your Reown Cloud project after adding relevant Notification Type, Title, Body & Link.

### Enabling Notify API

Once all changes have been saved and the `did.json` file has been deployed successfully, switch on the toggle switch in the Notify API section of your Reown Cloud project. If everything is configured correctly, you should see a success toast: “Notify configuration successfully verified”

Send Notifications in Cloud
---------------------------

Once you have completed the setup steps, you can now send notifications to users who have subscribed to your app. [Read more](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/vue/notifications/cloud-sending)

Next steps
----------

1.  Now you are ready for accounts to subscribe to your app and send notifications to them using your Notify API Secret or with Reown Cloud.

  <content>Try AppKit Notifications
------------------------

The fastest way to try AppKit Notifications is to go to [app.web3inbox.com](https://app.web3inbox.com/) and try subscribing to some dapps. The [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/) is a universal inbox for web3 users to access all their notifications in one place.

*   [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/)

Or access the repo at [github.com/WalletConnect/web3inbox](https://github.com/WalletConnect/web3inbox/).

Native notifications
--------------------

AppKit Notifications also supports native notifications on iOS and Android. To try native notifications, you can use the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/) and subscribe to dapps or build one of our sample apps.

A wallet that supports Notify is required to receive notifications.

Wallet notifications
--------------------

To try wallet notifications on a iOS or Android device, use a wallet that supports Notify. Alternatively, try building one of our sample apps, or grab a sample wallet preview build from Testflight or Firebase.

<page>
  <title>Verify - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/vue/cloud/verify</url>
  <content>Verify API is a security-focused feature that allows wallets to notify end-users when they may be connecting to a suspicious or malicious domain, helping to prevent phishing attacks across the industry.

Once a wallet knows whether an end-user is on uniswap.com or eviluniswap.com, it can help them to detect potentially harmful connections through Verify’s combined offering of Reown’s domain registry.

Cloud Verification
------------------

In order to verify your app domain in Reown Cloud follow these steps:

1.  Head over to [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/)
    
2.  Create a new project or click on the project you would like to verify.
    
3.  On the settings tab, head over to the ‘Domain verification’ section and fill in the website URL that you wish to verify.
    

4.  Click on the copy button and head over to your domain Name Registrar/Provider to edit your DNS records. Alternatively, if you can’t manage DNS records for your project (eg: ENS or vercel.app) you can host a static file under `/.well-known/walletconnect.txt` which contains the entire verification code that you copied. If you are using the static file method, you can jump over step 7.
    
5.  Under `Type`, select `TXT`. In the “Answer” section, paste the text you copied from the cloud dashboard. This field may vary across DNS dashboards. If you’re trying to register a subdomain, add it under `Host`. Feel free to leave TTL at its default value.
    

6.  Depending on your DNS settings, this might take a while to reflect. You can check out DNS settings for your website with CLI tools like Dig or with websites like [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=txt)
    
7.  Once this is done and you have confirmed this change is reflected, head on back to your Cloud Dashboard and click on Verify.
    

8.  You should see a toast pop up in the bottom right section of your screen and the domain verification section should have a green tick next to it.</content>

<page>
  <title>Relay - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/vue/cloud/relay</url>
  <content>Project ID
----------

The Project ID is consumed through URL parameters.

URL parameters used:

*   `projectId`: Your Project ID can be obtained from [cloud.reown.com](https://cloud.reown.com/)

Example URL:

`https://relay.walletconnect.com/?projectId=c4f79cc821944d9680842e34466bfbd`

This can be instantiated from the client with the `projectId` in the `SignClient` constructor.

Allowlist
---------

To help prevent malicious use of your project ID you are strongly encouraged to set an allowlist of [origins](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin) or application/bundle ids for mobile applications where the project ID is used. Requests from other origins will be denied.

*   Allowlist supports a list of origins in the format `[scheme://]<hostname[:port]`.
*   [Application ID](https://developer.android.com/build/configure-app-module#set-application-id)/[Bundle IDs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/bundle_ids) typically are defined using the [reverse domain name notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation)

Using `localhost` (or `127.0.0.1`) is always permitted, and if empty all origins are allowed. Updates take 15 minutes to apply.

If scheme or port is specified, it must match exactly. Hostname must also match exactly, but wildcards can be used for individual labels within the hostname.

Example of possible origins in the allowlist:

*   `example.com` - allows `https://example.com` or `http://example.com` but not `https://www.example.com`
*   `https://example.com` - allows `https://example.com` but not `http://example.com`
*   `https://www.example.com` - allows `https://www.example.com` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://example.com:8080` - allows `https://example.com:8080` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://*.example.com` - allows `https://www.example.com` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://*.*.example.com` - allows `https://www.subdomain.example.com` but not `https://www.example.com` or `https://example.com`
*   `https://www.*.example.com` - allows `https://www.subdomain.example.com` but not `https://www.example.com`
*   `https://www-*.example.com` - invalid; `*` must be the full label

Error Codes
-----------

| Reason | Error Code |
| --- | --- |
| Project ID doesn’t exist OR JWT is expired | 401 |
| Exists and is invalid | 403 |
| Too many requests | 1013 |

Websocket Close Codes
---------------------

| Code | Description | Reconnect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1001 | Server terminating | Yes |
| 4008 | Client stale: connected without a prior subscription and is not sending data | When needed |
| 4010 | Load Rebalancing | Yes |

Best Practices
--------------

*   Create a new `projectId` for each project. This allows for more granular control, dedicated explorer listings, and project metrics.
*   Don’t reuse a `projectId`.
*   Use the AllowList to limit unauthorized usage.
*   Avoid committing projects keys to the repo. Use env variables instead.

### Definitions

Definitions of terms used in Reown Analytics.

| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Relay:Session** | A session within the context of Relay analytics denotes meaningful user actions, like signing transactions for NFT sales or trades, within a wallet or dapp. It emphasizes core SDK functionality. |
| **AppKit:Session** | A session within the context of AppKit analytics represents the connection established between your project and your user’s device (includes browsers). Sessions are created when the user interacts with AppKit on your app. If user events are tracked within a 30-minute range, they will be considered within the same session. |
| **Message** | Messages are data exchanges between the Reown SDK and the Relay Server, facilitating communication between your project and connected clients. |
| **Client** | A client is a device or browser connected to your project. |
| **Blockchain API** | The interface that allows your project to interact with the blockchain. Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) are used to request information or execute operations on the blockchain through this API. |
| **Chain ID** | Chain ID identifies a specific blockchain network. Different blockchain networks, such as Ethereum Mainnet or a testnet, have unique Chain IDs. |</content>

  <content>Chains
------

### Get selected chain

You can get selected chain by calling the `getSelectedChain()` on the `AppKit` object.

    AppKit.getSelectedChain()
    

AppKit.ModalDelegate
--------------------

    val appKitModalDelegate = object : AppKit.ModalDelegate {
        override fun onSessionApproved(approvedSession: Modal.Model.ApprovedSession) {
            // Triggered when receives the session approval from wallet
        }
    
        override fun onSessionRejected(rejectedSession: Modal.Model.RejectedSession) {
            // Triggered when receives the session rejection from wallet
        }
    
        override fun onSessionUpdate(updatedSession: Modal.Model.UpdatedSession) {
            // Triggered when receives the session update from wallet
        }
    
        override fun onSessionExtend(session: Modal.Model.Session) {
            // Triggered when receives the session extend from wallet
        }
    
        override fun onSessionEvent(sessionEvent: Modal.Model.SessionEvent) {
            // Triggered when the peer emits events that match the list of events agreed upon session settlement
        }
    
        override fun onSessionDelete(deletedSession: Modal.Model.DeletedSession) {
            // Triggered when receives the session delete from wallet
        }
    
        override fun onSessionRequestResponse(response: Modal.Model.SessionRequestResponse) {
            // Triggered when receives the session request response from wallet
        }
    
        override fun onProposalExpired(proposal: Modal.Model.ExpiredProposal) {
            // Triggered when a proposal becomes expired
        }
    
        override fun onRequestExpired(request: Modal.Model.ExpiredRequest) {
            // Triggered when a request becomes expired
        }
    
        override fun onConnectionStateChange(state: Modal.Model.ConnectionState) {
            //Triggered whenever the connection state is changed
        }
    
        override fun onError(error: Modal.Model.Error) {
            // Triggered whenever there is an issue inside the SDK
        }
    }
    

You have set delegate on AppKit to start getting updates from Wallet.

        AppKit.setDelegate(appKitModalDelegate)

        /* callback for error while trying to disconnection with a peer */
        }
    )
    

### Request

    val requestParams = Modal.Params.Request(
        method = /* Selected method */,
        params = /* Method params  */,
    )
    
    AppKit.request(
        request = requestParams,
        onSuccess = {
        /* callback that letting you know that you have successful request */
        },
        onError = { error ->

    val projectId = "" // Get Project ID at https://cloud.reown.com/
    val appMetaData = Core.Model.AppMetaData(
        name = "Kotlin.AppKit",
        description = "Kotlin AppKit Implementation",
        url = "kotlin.reown.com",
        icons = listOf("https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/spaces%2F-LJJeCjcLrr53DcT1Ml7%2Favatar.png?alt=media"),
        redirect = "kotlin-modal-wc://request"
    )
    
    CoreClient.initialize(projectId = projectId, connectionType = connectionType, application = this, metaData = appMetaData)
    
    AppKit.initialize(
        init = Modal.Params.Init(CoreClient),
        onSuccess = {
            // Callback will be called if initialization is successful
         },
        onError = { error ->
            // Error will be thrown if there's an issue during initialization
        }
    )
    

#### Session properties

You can define session properties by calling the `setSessionProperties` method on the `AppKit` object.

#### Chains

This example of define ethereum chain. You can define the chains you want to use. The chain must be EVM compatible.

    Example of definition chains: https://github.com/reown-com/reown-kotlin/blob/main/product/appkit/src/main/kotlin/com/reown/appkit/presets/AppKitChainsPresets.kt
    
    AppKit.setChains(AppKitChainsPresets.ethChains.values.toList())
    

**IMPORTANT**: `Chains` must be set before opening the modal.

  <title>Verify - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/android/cloud/verify</url>
  <content>Verify API is a security-focused feature that allows wallets to notify end-users when they may be connecting to a suspicious or malicious domain, helping to prevent phishing attacks across the industry.

Once a wallet knows whether an end-user is on uniswap.com or eviluniswap.com, it can help them to detect potentially harmful connections through Verify’s combined offering of Reown’s domain registry.

Cloud Verification
------------------

In order to verify your app domain in Reown Cloud follow these steps:

1.  Head over to [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/)
    
2.  Create a new project or click on the project you would like to verify.
    
3.  On the settings tab, head over to the ‘Domain verification’ section and fill in the website URL that you wish to verify.
    

4.  Click on the copy button and head over to your domain Name Registrar/Provider to edit your DNS records. Alternatively, if you can’t manage DNS records for your project (eg: ENS or vercel.app) you can host a static file under `/.well-known/walletconnect.txt` which contains the entire verification code that you copied. If you are using the static file method, you can jump over step 7.
    
5.  Under `Type`, select `TXT`. In the “Answer” section, paste the text you copied from the cloud dashboard. This field may vary across DNS dashboards. If you’re trying to register a subdomain, add it under `Host`. Feel free to leave TTL at its default value.
    

6.  Depending on your DNS settings, this might take a while to reflect. You can check out DNS settings for your website with CLI tools like Dig or with websites like [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=txt)
    
7.  Once this is done and you have confirmed this change is reflected, head on back to your Cloud Dashboard and click on Verify.

  <title>Relay - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/android/cloud/relay</url>
  <content>Project ID
----------

The Project ID is consumed through URL parameters.

URL parameters used:

*   `projectId`: Your Project ID can be obtained from [cloud.reown.com](https://cloud.reown.com/)

Example URL:

`https://relay.walletconnect.com/?projectId=c4f79cc821944d9680842e34466bfbd`

This can be instantiated from the client with the `projectId` in the `SignClient` constructor.

Allowlist
---------

To help prevent malicious use of your project ID you are strongly encouraged to set an allowlist of [origins](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin) or application/bundle ids for mobile applications where the project ID is used. Requests from other origins will be denied.

*   Allowlist supports a list of origins in the format `[scheme://]<hostname[:port]`.
*   [Application ID](https://developer.android.com/build/configure-app-module#set-application-id)/[Bundle IDs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/bundle_ids) typically are defined using the [reverse domain name notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation)

Using `localhost` (or `127.0.0.1`) is always permitted, and if empty all origins are allowed. Updates take 15 minutes to apply.

If scheme or port is specified, it must match exactly. Hostname must also match exactly, but wildcards can be used for individual labels within the hostname.

Example of possible origins in the allowlist:

*   `example.com` - allows `https://example.com` or `http://example.com` but not `https://www.example.com`
*   `https://example.com` - allows `https://example.com` but not `http://example.com`
*   `https://www.example.com` - allows `https://www.example.com` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://example.com:8080` - allows `https://example.com:8080` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://*.example.com` - allows `https://www.example.com` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://*.*.example.com` - allows `https://www.subdomain.example.com` but not `https://www.example.com` or `https://example.com`
*   `https://www.*.example.com` - allows `https://www.subdomain.example.com` but not `https://www.example.com`
*   `https://www-*.example.com` - invalid; `*` must be the full label

Error Codes
-----------

| Reason | Error Code |
| --- | --- |
| Project ID doesn’t exist OR JWT is expired | 401 |
| Exists and is invalid | 403 |
| Too many requests | 1013 |

Websocket Close Codes
---------------------

| Code | Description | Reconnect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1001 | Server terminating | Yes |
| 4008 | Client stale: connected without a prior subscription and is not sending data | When needed |
| 4010 | Load Rebalancing | Yes |

Best Practices
--------------

*   Create a new `projectId` for each project. This allows for more granular control, dedicated explorer listings, and project metrics.
*   Don’t reuse a `projectId`.
*   Use the AllowList to limit unauthorized usage.
*   Avoid committing projects keys to the repo. Use env variables instead.

  <title>Custom connectors - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/next/core/custom-connectors</url>
  <content>If you already have Wagmi integrated into your application or would like more control over Wagmi’s configuration, you can integrate AppKit on top of it.

Adding custom connectors like WalletConnect and Coinbase is optional.

By default, [EIP-6963](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963) and WC connectors are provided out of the box.

    import { createAppKit } from '@reown/appkit/react'
    import { WagmiAdapter } from '@reown/appkit-adapter-wagmi'
    
    import { http, WagmiProvider, CreateConnectorFn } from 'wagmi'
    import { sepolia } from '@reown/appkit/networks'
    import { walletConnect, coinbaseWallet, injected } from 'wagmi/connectors'
    import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query'
    
    const queryClient = new QueryClient()
    
    export const projectId = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID
    
    const metadata = {
      //...
    }
    
    // create the connectors (delete the ones you don't need)
    const connectors: CreateConnectorFn[] = []
    connectors.push(walletConnect({ projectId, metadata, showQrModal: false })) // showQrModal must be false
    connectors.push(injected({ shimDisconnect: true }))
    connectors.push(
      coinbaseWallet({
        appName: metadata.name,
        appLogoUrl: metadata.icons[0]
      })
    )
    
    export const networks = [sepolia]
    
    export const wagmiAdapter = new WagmiAdapter({
      storage:
      transports: {
        [sepolia.id]: http()
      },
      connectors,
      projectId,
      networks
    })
    
    export const config = wagmiAdapter.wagmiConfig
    
    createAppKit({
      adapters: [wagmiAdapter],
      projectId,
      networks: [sepolia]
    })
    
    export function ContextProvider({ children }) {
      return (
        <WagmiProvider config={config}>
          <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>{children}</QueryClientProvider>
        </WagmiProvider>
      )
    }
    

Add custom wallet adapters for Solana wallets by first installing the wallet adapter package and then including the adapters in the wallets array. You can find a more Solana wallet adapters [here](https://github.com/anza-xyz/wallet-adapter/tree/master/packages/wallets).

    npm install @solana/wallet-adapter-wallets
    

    import { createAppKit } from "@reown/appkit/react";
    import { SolanaAdapter } from "@reown/appkit-adapter-solana/react";
    import { solana, solanaTestnet, solanaDevnet } from "@reown/appkit/networks";
    
    import {
      SolflareWalletAdapter,
      PhantomWalletAdapter,
    } from "@solana/wallet-adapter-wallets";
    
    // 0. Set up Solana adapter
    const solanaWeb3JsAdapter = new SolanaAdapter({
      wallets: [new PhantomWalletAdapter(), new SolflareWalletAdapter()],
    });
    
    // 1. Get projectId from https://cloud.reown.com
    const projectId = "YOUR_PROJECT_ID";
    
    // 2. Set up the metadata
    const metadata = {
      //...
    };
    
    // 3. Create the modal
    const modal = createAppKit({
      adapters: [solanaWeb3JsAdapter],
      networks: [solana, solanaTestnet, solanaDevnet],
      metadata: metadata,
      projectId,
      features: {

  <title>Smart Accounts - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/next/core/smart-accounts</url>
  <content>Overview
--------

Smart Accounts (SAs) are enabled by default within AppKit. These accounts enhance functionality by emitting 1271 and 6492 signatures, which should be taken into account for signature verification processes, such as Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE).

### Deployment

Smart Accounts are deployed alongside the first transaction. Until deployment, a precalculated address, known as the counterfactual address, is displayed. Despite not being deployed, the account can still sign using 6492 signatures.

### Supported Networks

Smart Accounts are available on the following networks:

*   Base Sepolia
*   BSC (Binance Smart Chain)
*   Fraximal
*   Linea
*   Mode
*   Optimism
*   Polygon
*   Polygon Mumbai
*   Sepolia

### User Eligibility

Smart Accounts are exclusively available for embedded wallet users (email and social login)

FAQ
---

### What is a Smart Account?

A Smart Account improves the traditional account experience by replacing Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) with a Smart Contract that follows the [ERC-4337 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337). This opens up many use cases that were previously unavailable.

Smart Accounts do no require Private Keys or Seed Phrases, instead they rely on a key or multiple keys from designated signers to access the smart account and perform actions on chain. The keys can take multiple forms including passkeys and EOA signatures.

### What can I do with a Smart Account?

Smart accounts unlock a host of use cases that were previously unavailable with EOAs. Essentially anything that can be programmed into a smart contract can be used by Smart Accounts.

*   **Automated Transactions:** Set up recurring payments or conditional transfers.
*   **Multi-Signature Authorization:** Require multiple approvals for a transaction to increase security.
*   **Delegated Transactions:** Allow a third party to execute transactions on your behalf under specific conditions.
*   **Enhanced Security:** Implement complex security mechanisms such as time-locked transactions and withdrawal limits.
*   **Interoperability:** Interact seamlessly with decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.
*   **Custom Logic:** Create custom transaction rules and workflows that align with personal or business requirements.

### How do I get a Smart Account?

Existing AppKit Universal Wallet Users will be given the option to upgrade their account to a smart account. Once you upgrade you will still be able to access your EOA and self-custody your account.

New AppKit Universal Wallet Users will be given smart accounts by default when they login for the first time.

### Does it cost anything?

There is a small additional cost for activating your smart account. The activation fee is added to the first transaction and covers the network fees required for deploying the new smart contract onchain.

### Can I export my Smart Account?

No, you cannot export your Smart Account. The Smart Account (SA) is deployed by the EOA and is owned by the EOA. Your EOA account will always be exportable. Also is good to know that SA don’t have seedphrases.

### Can I withdraw all my funds from my Smart Account?

Yes, you can withdraw all your funds from your Smart Account.

### What are account names?

Smart account addresses start with ’0x’ followed by 42 characters, this is the unique address of your smart account on the network. ‘0x’ addresses like this are long, unwieldy and unmemorable. AppKit allows you to assign a more memorable name for your smart account using [ENS Resolvers](https://docs.ens.domains/resolvers/ccip-read).

You can assign a name to your account and this will act as an alias for your account that can be shared publicly and provide a better user experience. AppKit account names are followed by the “reown.id” domain.

### What can I do with my account name?

As AppKit smart account addresses are the same across the supported networks by [Pimlico](https://docs.pimlico.io/infra/platform/supported-chains), you only need one account name which can then be used across the networks.

For example if you want someone to send you USDC on Polygon they can send it to “johnsmith.reown.id”. If you want someone wants to send you USDC on Optimism they can also use “johnsmith.reown.id”.</content>

  <title>Custom networks - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/next/core/custom-networks</url>
  <content>If you cannot find the network you are looking for within the `@reown/appkit/networks` path, you can always add a custom network.

Since AppKit v1.1.0, there are two ways to add your network to AppKit:

### 1\. Adding Your Chain to Viem’s Directory (Recommended)

Reown AppKit use Viem to provide EVM chains to users under the hood. If your chain is EVM-compatible, it is recommended to open a PR to Viem to add your network to Viem’s directory. Once your chain is accepted by Viem, it will automatically be available in AppKit with no additional steps required.

**Here is the documentation of how to add new chain to Viem:** [https://github.com/wevm/viem/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#chains](https://github.com/wevm/viem/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#chains)

### 2\. Creating a Custom Chain Object

You can also create a custom network object without waiting for approval from Viem’s repository.

**Required Information**

You will need the following values to create a custom network:

*   **id**: Chain ID of the network.
*   **name**: Name of the network.
*   **caipNetworkId**: CAIP-2 compliant network ID.
*   **chainNamespace**: Chain namespace.
*   **nativeCurrency**: Native currency of the network.
*   **rpcUrls**: Object containing the RPC URLs for the network.
*   **blockExplorers**: Object containing the block explorers for the network.</content>

  <title>Sign In With X - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/next/core/siwx</url>
  <content>Introduction
------------

The **Sign In With X** feature enables decentralized applications (Dapps) to authenticate users seamlessly across multiple blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, Polygon or Solana. This feature allows developers using our SDK to implement authentication by having users sign a unique string message with their blockchain wallets. The **Sign In With X** feature is designed in accordance with the [CAIP-122](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/main/CAIPs/caip-122.md) standard, which establishes a chain-agnostic framework for blockchain-based authentication and authorization on off-chain services.

  
[

Try Demo
--------



](https://appkit-lab.reown.com/library/siwx-default/)  

Getting Started
---------------

**SIWX** works as a plugin system for AppKit and you are going to add the plugin in the AppKit configuration. There are some ways to implement the **SIWX** feature:

*   Use the default implementation provided by AppKit
*   Use Cloud Auth SIWX to manage the sessions in the Cloud Dashboard
*   Create a custom implementation to suit your specific requirements.

To initialize the **SIWX** feature, you need to add the `siwx` parameter to the `createAppKit` function.

### Default Implementation

By using the default implementation, you can quickly integrate the **SIWX** feature into your Dapp. The default implementation provides a set of pre-built components that allow you to have the feature up and running in no time.

Read more about the [Default Implementation](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/next/core/siwx-default).

### Cloud Auth Implementation

The Cloud Auth SIWX is a predefined implementation of the SIWX configuration plugin that uses the Cloud service to create and manage SIWX messages and sessions. With Cloud Auth SIWX, you will be able to see and control the sessions of your users using the [User Management Dashboard](https://docs.reown.com/cloud/user-management).

Read more about the [Cloud Auth Implementation](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/next/core/siwx-cloud-auth).

### Custom Implementation

The `siwx` param expects to receive a defined interface from which you are able to create your own implementation. This is what allows you to customize the feature to suit your specific requirements.

The defined interface must follow specific rules to make sure that AppKit can interact with it correctly. Read more about how to have your [Custom Implementation](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/next/core/siwx-custom).

SIWX Expected Behavior
----------------------

*   **SIWX** will prompt to get the user signature and verify his identity every time a connection happen;
*   In case a SIWX session is already stored, the user will be automatically signed in and the prompt step will be skipped;
*   If the user changes the connected network, **SIWX** will prompt to get the user signature and verify his identity again;
*   If the user disconnects from the Dapp, **SIWX** will revoke the session and the user will need to sign in again.

Migrating from SIWE to SIWX
---------------------------

If you are currently already using **SIWE** from `@reown/appkit-siwe`, after AppKit version 1.5.0, you will be migrated into **SIWX**. The migration process is automatic and your `siweConfig` from `createAppKit` function will be mapped internally.</content>

  <title>Backend Integration - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/next/notifications/backend-integration</url>
  <content>Once an account is subscribed to your app’s notifications you can test sending notifications to the account. You can subscribe in your app directly with our [Frontend Integration](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/next/notifications/frontend-integration/usage), or with one of the below testing options.

We recommend testing notifications with the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/) which supports push notifications and can be installed to your phone. You can also try one of our sample wallets:

*   [iOS sample wallet](https://testflight.apple.com/join/09bTAryp)
*   [Android sample wallet](https://appdistribution.firebase.dev/i/d2c86e879abd5a86)

Authentication
--------------

To send notifications and access all subscriber information for your dapp, you will need your Notify API Secret and project ID.

You can find the Notify API Secret under the Notify API section of the APIs tab of your project on [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/). Follow steps on the [Cloud Setup](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/next/notifications/cloud-setup) page to configure this. This secret allows publishing notifications to any account subscribed to your app, so should not be published and should only be used by your app backend.

Sending notifications
---------------------

Only plaintext is supported, and newlines are ignored.

To send a notification notification you can call the `/notify` endpoint. This endpoint supports the following fields:

*   `type` - The Notification type ID copied from Reown Cloud.
*   `title` - The title of the notification. Max 64 characters.
*   `body` - The body of the notification containing more detail. Max 255 characters.
*   `url` (optional) - A URL attached to the notification that the user can navigate to. Max 255 characters.
*   `accounts` - A list of [CAIP-10](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/main/CAIPs/caip-10.md) account IDs for which to send the notification to. Max 500 accounts per request. Also see the [rate limits](https://docs.reown.com/_sites/docs.reown.com/appkit/next/notifications/backend-integration#rate-limits) below.
*   `notification_id` (optional) - An idempotency key of arbitrary format used to deduplicate multiple requests. Max 255 characters. Multiple calls with the same `notification_id` will use the first call’s `notification` content, but will send to any additional account IDs listed in `accounts`.

Example usage:

Get subscribers
---------------

You can tell if an account is subscribed and get information about subscribers using the `/v1/<project-id>/subscribers` endpoint. You can provide up to 100 accounts in the request.

If the account is subscribed, it will be returned as a key in the response along with a list of subscribed notification types as the value. If the account is not a subscriber, it will not be returned in the response.

Example usage:

Example response:

Get all subscribers
-------------------

You can get a list of all of the currently-subscribed accounts by calling the `/<project-id>/subscribers` endpoint.

Example usage:

Mark all notifications as read
------------------------------

Unless marked as read by an app frontend, notifications will always be “unread”. Because of this, when you initially add support for displaying unread status or unread count to your frontend, users that have received notifications in the past will have notifications display as “unread” even if they already have seen them. This can potentially be an undesirable user experience.

To mitigate this problem, you can make a one-time call to the `/v1/<project-id>/mark-all-as-read` API endpoint which will mark all existing notifications as read. Notifications marked as read in this way will not contribute to read rate analytics. After you deploy your integration of unread states, you can call this endpoint to reset the unread state for all of your existing notifications.

Rate limits
-----------

To protect our system and subscribers, various limits and rate limits are in-place.

Rate limits are implemented as [token bucket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket) and contain both rate and burst amounts. On average, a rate of requests can be made. However, since real-world applications often make requests in bursts, this fixed rate can be surpassed temporarily up to the burst amount, provided the app subsequently makes requests below the average in order to recover its bursting capability.

*   `POST /<project-id>/notify`:
    *   Each app can send 2 notifications per hour to an account, with a burst up to 50. Accounts that have been rate limited will be returned in the request response. Exceptions may be made on a per-project basis for special circumstances.
    *   Each app can call this endpoint 2 times per second with a burst up to 20. Rate limited requests will return a 429 status code.
*   `POST /v1/<project-id>/subscribers`
    *   Each app can call this endpoint 100 times per second with a burst up to 100. Rate limited requests will return a 429 status code.
*   `GET /<project-id>/subscribers`
    *   Each app can call this endpoint 1 time every 5 minutes with a burst up to 2. Rate limited requests will return a 429 status code.
*   `POST /v1/<project-id>/mark-all-as-read`
    *   Each app can call this endpoint 1 time per hour with a burst up to 5. Rate limited requests will return a 429 status code.</content>

  <title>Smart Sessions - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/next/early-access/smart-session</url>
  <content>Overview
--------

Smart Sessions allow developers to easily integrate session-based permission handling within their decentralized applications (dApps). Using the `grantPermissions` method, can send permission requests to wallets.

For users, this means a simpler experience. Instead of approving every action individually, they can allow access for a single session, making it faster and easier to use apps without dealing with constant pop-ups or interruptions.

With Smart Sessions, approved actions are carried out by the app’s backend during the session. This allows transactions to be processed automatically, making the experience even more seamless while ensuring that everything stays within the permissions set by the user.

This guide will walk you through on how to use the `grantPermissions` method, including the basic setup and an example of how to request permissions from a wallet.

Implementations
---------------

The `grantPermissions` method provides an easy way to interact with the smart wallet to request permissions.

### Step 1 | Install the library

### Step 2 | Import the method

First, import the grantPermissions method from the `@reown/appkit-experimental/smart-session` package.

### Step 3 | Define the Permission Request

Create an object adhering to the `SmartSessionGrantPermissionsRequest` type. This object specifies details like the `address`, `chainID`, `signer`, `policies`, `permissions`, and `expiry` time.

Example request object:

### Step 4 | Invoke the Method

Call the `grantPermissions` function, passing the request object. This will trigger the permission request via the connected wallet.

### Step 5 | Handle the Response

Upon successful execution, the response will include the granted permissions and the session context. So the response can be handled as needed.

#### Response Format

How to use the permissions
--------------------------

The dApp must call the following two endpoints from the wallet services API to use these permissions.

1.  `https://rpc.walletconnect.org/v1/wallets/prepareCalls` - Accepts an EIP-5792 `wallet_sendCalls` request. Responds with the prepared calls (in the case of Appkit Embedded Wallet, an Entrypoint v0.7 user operation), some context, and a signature request.
2.  `https://rpc.walletconnect.org/v1/wallets/sendPreparedCalls` - Accepts prepared calls, a signature, and the context returned from prepareCalls if present. Returns an EIP-5792 calls ID.

### Steps to follow for executing any async action by the dApp backend.

1.  Dapp makes the `wallet_prepareCalls` JSON RPC call to the wallet service API. Accepts an EIP-5792 `wallet_sendCalls` request, and returns the prepared calls according to the account’s implementation.
    
    #### Parameter
    

#### Return value

2.  App developers are expected to Sign the `signatureRequest.hash` returned from `wallet_prepareCalls` call using the dApp key (secp256k1 or secp256r1)
    
3.  dApps makes the `wallet_sendPreparedCalls` JSON RPC call to wallet service API. The RPC accepts the prepared response from `wallet_prepareCalls` request along with a signature, and returns an [EIP-5792](https://eip.tools/eip/5792) call bundle ID.

  <title>Chain Abstraction - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/next/early-access/chain-abstraction</url>
  <content>Overview
--------

Chain abstraction simplifies interactions across different blockchains, allowing users to transact seamlessly without worrying about network-specific tokens.

To fully leverage chain abstraction, wallets need to support its implementation, and minor adjustments are required on the Dapp side.

Dapps may not always be aware of the balances across different chains or accounts that wallets can access. Therefore, it’s crucial to ensure that the call does not fail on the Dapp side.

This guide focuses on the most common ways Dapps interact with wallets using the Wagmi library.

Implementations
---------------

### useSendTransaction

The `useSendTransaction` hook attempts to estimate gas on the Dapp side before forwarding the call to the wallet. However, gas estimation might fail because the Dapp may not account for all the funds available to the wallet across different chains.

To ensure the call is sent successfully, the wallet must handle gas estimation. You need to pass `gas: null` to the sendTransaction method.

  <title>Cloud Setup - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/next/notifications/cloud-setup</url>
  <content>This page explains the configuration required in order to obtain a Notify API Secret and configure your project to send notifications.

For a quick start to experiment with, you can try the [web3inbox template](https://github.com/WalletConnect/web3inbox-client/tree/main/apps/web) and following the steps in the README.

Domain to use
-------------

It is important to understand what domain you are using for your project as you are required to host a static file (the `did.json` file) on this domain before being able to use Notify API. The [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/) and clients receiving and managing your notifications use this file to authenticate that your domain is associated with the source of the notifications.

You can pick 1 domain and this is configured in the Dapp URL field of the Notify API section of the [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/). You may change your domain at any time, as long as you properly host the new `did.json` file there. Note that only one project may use a given domain at the same time.

During development it is optional to use your production domain for testing. Instead, you can use a staging domain, or even a entirely separate domain e.g. Vercel test site. However, once you move to production you will need to update your domain to your production domain and host a new file there.

Note that the file must be hosted on a real, publicly accessible, domain in order to verify its legitimacy. The use of `localhost` or other local addresses is not allowed.

Dapp name, description, and logo
--------------------------------

The dapp name, description, and logo are displayed in wallets that integrate Notify API as well as in the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/). These details should be provided for the best user experience and to help the user identify your app.

Notification types
------------------

Notification types are an important feature of Notify API and are a way for a user to have control over what types of notifications they receive. Users can change their notification types at any time in your app, their wallet, or the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/). When sending notifications, you must use one of these configured notification types which you reference in code by its UUID.

Notification types are configured with a name, description, and icon which allow the user understand what types of notifications they would receive for that type. When a user receives a push notification on their device, they will see the icon that is configured with the notification type. Examples of notification types may include “Account updates” or “Service updates”.

Setup steps
-----------

### Navigating to Notify API section

In [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/), navigate to the APIs tab of your project.

### Configuring Notify API

Under Notify API > Configuration > `DAPP INFORMATION`, fill in the Dapp URL field. This is the domain of your app that you will use to publish notifications.

### Adding Notification Image and Types

Under the same section, next to Notification types, click on the “Add Notification Type” button and add a title, notification image and description for your notification type. This is the type of notification that your app will publish.

For example, if you are going to send promotional content as notification, you might want to add a notification type called “Promotional” with a description “Promotional content from the XYZ Team.”. You can also add a relevant image for the notification type.

### Saving Changes

Optionally, you can add a logo and description for your project. This will be shown to users when they subscribe to your app. Click “Save” to save your changes.

### Notify Secret

Take note of your new Notify API Secret. You will need this to publish notifications. This secret allows publishing notifications to any account subscribed to your app, so should not be published and should only be used by your app backend.

### Hosting did.json file

Next, you will need to host `did.json` file on this page at the `/.well-known/` directory of your public URL. Please also ensure that your application has CORS enabled. An example is linked [here.](https://github.com/WalletConnect/gm-dapp/blob/main/next.config.js)

*   Download `did.json` (click on `DID:WEB` section to show the download button ) and host it at, for example, `https://app.example.com/.well-known/did.json`
    

### Enabling Welcome Notifications

Welcome Notifications are notifications that are sent to users when they subscribe to your app. This is a great way to welcome users to your app and explain what types of notifications they will receive.

To enable Welcome Notifications, switch on the toggle in the Welcome Notifications section of your Reown Cloud project after adding relevant Notification Type, Title, Body & Link.

### Enabling Notify API

Once all changes have been saved and the `did.json` file has been deployed successfully, switch on the toggle switch in the Notify API section of your Reown Cloud project. If everything is configured correctly, you should see a success toast: “Notify configuration successfully verified”

Send Notifications in Cloud
---------------------------

Once you have completed the setup steps, you can now send notifications to users who have subscribed to your app. [Read more](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/next/notifications/cloud-sending)

  <content>Try AppKit Notifications
------------------------

The fastest way to try AppKit Notifications is to go to [app.web3inbox.com](https://app.web3inbox.com/) and try subscribing to some dapps. The [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/) is a universal inbox for web3 users to access all their notifications in one place.

*   [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/)

Or access the repo at [github.com/WalletConnect/web3inbox](https://github.com/WalletConnect/web3inbox/).

Native notifications
--------------------

AppKit Notifications also supports native notifications on iOS and Android. To try native notifications, you can use the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/) and subscribe to dapps or build one of our sample apps.

A wallet that supports Notify is required to receive notifications.

Wallet notifications
--------------------

To try wallet notifications on a iOS or Android device, use a wallet that supports Notify. Alternatively, try building one of our sample apps, or grab a sample wallet preview build from Testflight or Firebase.

  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/next/cloud/relay</url>
  <content>Project ID
----------

The Project ID is consumed through URL parameters.

URL parameters used:

*   `projectId`: Your Project ID can be obtained from [cloud.reown.com](https://cloud.reown.com/)

Example URL:

`https://relay.walletconnect.com/?projectId=c4f79cc821944d9680842e34466bfbd`

This can be instantiated from the client with the `projectId` in the `SignClient` constructor.

Allowlist
---------

To help prevent malicious use of your project ID you are strongly encouraged to set an allowlist of [origins](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin) or application/bundle ids for mobile applications where the project ID is used. Requests from other origins will be denied.

*   Allowlist supports a list of origins in the format `[scheme://]<hostname[:port]`.
*   [Application ID](https://developer.android.com/build/configure-app-module#set-application-id)/[Bundle IDs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/bundle_ids) typically are defined using the [reverse domain name notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation)

Using `localhost` (or `127.0.0.1`) is always permitted, and if empty all origins are allowed. Updates take 15 minutes to apply.

If scheme or port is specified, it must match exactly. Hostname must also match exactly, but wildcards can be used for individual labels within the hostname.

Example of possible origins in the allowlist:

*   `example.com` - allows `https://example.com` or `http://example.com` but not `https://www.example.com`
*   `https://example.com` - allows `https://example.com` but not `http://example.com`
*   `https://www.example.com` - allows `https://www.example.com` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://example.com:8080` - allows `https://example.com:8080` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://*.example.com` - allows `https://www.example.com` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://*.*.example.com` - allows `https://www.subdomain.example.com` but not `https://www.example.com` or `https://example.com`
*   `https://www.*.example.com` - allows `https://www.subdomain.example.com` but not `https://www.example.com`
*   `https://www-*.example.com` - invalid; `*` must be the full label

Error Codes
-----------

| Reason | Error Code |
| --- | --- |
| Project ID doesn’t exist OR JWT is expired | 401 |
| Exists and is invalid | 403 |
| Too many requests | 1013 |

Websocket Close Codes
---------------------

| Code | Description | Reconnect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1001 | Server terminating | Yes |
| 4008 | Client stale: connected without a prior subscription and is not sending data | When needed |
| 4010 | Load Rebalancing | Yes |

Best Practices
--------------

*   Create a new `projectId` for each project. This allows for more granular control, dedicated explorer listings, and project metrics.
*   Don’t reuse a `projectId`.
*   Use the AllowList to limit unauthorized usage.
*   Avoid committing projects keys to the repo. Use env variables instead.

*   [Project ID](#project-id)

  <title>Verify - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/next/cloud/verify</url>
  <content>Verify API is a security-focused feature that allows wallets to notify end-users when they may be connecting to a suspicious or malicious domain, helping to prevent phishing attacks across the industry.

Once a wallet knows whether an end-user is on uniswap.com or eviluniswap.com, it can help them to detect potentially harmful connections through Verify’s combined offering of Reown’s domain registry.

Cloud Verification
------------------

In order to verify your app domain in Reown Cloud follow these steps:

1.  Head over to [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/)
    
2.  Create a new project or click on the project you would like to verify.
    
3.  On the settings tab, head over to the ‘Domain verification’ section and fill in the website URL that you wish to verify.
    

4.  Click on the copy button and head over to your domain Name Registrar/Provider to edit your DNS records. Alternatively, if you can’t manage DNS records for your project (eg: ENS or vercel.app) you can host a static file under `/.well-known/walletconnect.txt` which contains the entire verification code that you copied. If you are using the static file method, you can jump over step 7.
    
5.  Under `Type`, select `TXT`. In the “Answer” section, paste the text you copied from the cloud dashboard. This field may vary across DNS dashboards. If you’re trying to register a subdomain, add it under `Host`. Feel free to leave TTL at its default value.
    

6.  Depending on your DNS settings, this might take a while to reflect. You can check out DNS settings for your website with CLI tools like Dig or with websites like [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=txt)
    
7.  Once this is done and you have confirmed this change is reflected, head on back to your Cloud Dashboard and click on Verify.
    

8.  You should see a toast pop up in the bottom right section of your screen and the domain verification section should have a green tick next to it.</content>

  <title>Usage - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/flutter/core/usage</url>
  <content>Import the package:
-------------------

Create your `ReownAppKitModal()` instance, which is your primary class for opening, closing, disconnecting, etc.

Be sure to update the _project ID_ and _metadata_ with your own.

Initialization
--------------

In order to initialize `ReownAppKitModal()` instance you must provide a _projectId_ and a _metadata_.

Alternatively, `ReownAppKitModal()` allows you to create an instance by passing a `ReownAppKit()` object as follows:

The `metadata` object should contain your dApp’s name, description, url and icon. Redirect object is optional but _highly recommended_. See next session why.

Redirect to your dApp
---------------------

AppKit’s metadata object contains a `redirect` option that should be used by the wallet to redirected back to your dapp after connection.

But in order for the redirect mechanism to work you would also need to add the following in the iOS and Android native sides:

1.  Locate your `Info.plist` file under `your_project/ios/Runner/` folder.
2.  Locate the `<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>` section.
3.  Add your schema as `<dict>` entry within the `<array>` object as follows.

Available Buttons
-----------------

`AppKitModalConnectButton` to open modal and connect to a wallet or through social options

`AppKitModalNetworkSelectButton` to select an available network

`AppKitModalAccountButton` to open account screen once connected

`AppKitModalAddressButton` shows the address on the current selected network

`AppKitModalBalanceButton` shows wallet balance on the current selected network

To connect to a wallet you can either use `AppKitModalConnectButton` or `AppKitModalNetworkSelectButton`.

`AppKitModalNetworkSelectButton` will allow the user to pre-select a Network before connecting while `AppKitModalConnectButton` will directly show available wallets and social options.

Once connected, `AppKitModalConnectButton` will serve as Disconnect button while `AppKitModalAccountButton` will show basic account data such as balance and address and will be used to open Account screen.

Quick example:

`AppKitModalAccountButton` is composed by `AppKitModalBalanceButton` and `AppKitModalAddressButton` and you can use these separately from `AppKitModalAccountButton`

Custom Buttons
--------------

If you like you can also override AppKit’s buttons by using the `custom:` property as follows

`openModalView()` method can accept a “startWidget” argument that you can leverage to open specifics screens of the modal:</content>

  <title>Options - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/flutter/core/options</url>
  <content>### enableAnalytics:

Enable analytics to get more insights on your users activity within your [Reown Cloud’s dashboard](https://cloud.reown.com/)

### siweConfig:

Used to configure [One-Click Auth + Sign In With Ethereum](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/flutter/core/siwe) feature.

Will be disabled automatically if you decide to support/include non-EVM blockchains.

### featuresConfig:

Used to configure extra features such [Email and Social Login](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/flutter/core/email).

### getBalanceFallback:

This callback method will be triggered if getting the balance from our blockchain API fails due to unsupported network. You may replace this with your own `getBalance()` method if desired.

### requiredNamespaces: and optionalNamespaces:

These are the set of namespaces that will be requested to the wallet you are connecting to.

These values are optionals and, in most cases, not required since AppKit already defines every required and optional namespace internally based on configured networks.

However, if you would want to override that definition with your own or support more networks than just EVM and Solana (i.e. Polkadot, Kadena, etc…) these are the object you should modify. See [Custom Networks](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/flutter/core/custom-chains). section.

### featuredWalletIds:

Allows to override default recommended wallets that are fetched from the API. You can define an array of wallet ids you’d like to prioritize (order is respected). You can find the wallets IDs in our [Wallets List](https://docs.reown.com/cloud/wallets/wallet-list).

### includedWalletIds:

Similar to `featuredWalletIds` this option allows you to determine exactly which wallets do you want to show. If `includedWalletIds` is set then only the wallets listed in this object are going to be displayed in the modal.

### excludedWalletIds:

Similar to `includedWalletIds` this option allows you to exclude a list of wallets from the API response.</content>

  <title>Link Mode - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/flutter/core/link-mode</url>
  <content>AppKit Link Mode is a low latency mechanism for transporting One-Click Auth requests and session requests over Universal Links, reducing the need for a WebSocket connection with the Relay. This significantly enhances the user experience when connecting native dApps to native wallets by reducing the latency associated with network connections, especially when the user has an unstable internet connection.

By enabling it, the wallet and dapp will communicate through declared Universal Links on iOS and/or App Links on Android **even without an internet connection.**

### How to enable it:

1.  Add a Universal Link for your wallet in the **Explorer** tab of your [**Cloud project configuration**](https://cloud.reown.com/sign-in), under the **Mobile Linking** section
    
2.  Configure your `PairingMetadata`’s `redirect:` object with that Universal Link
    
3.  Set the `linkMode` property to `true`:
    

Once everything is properly configured, and the user interacts with a Link Mode-supporting Wallet, your dApp will receive responses through it.

In Flutter, there are several plugins that can help you integrate Universal/App Links. However, regardless of which one you choose, it is crucial that, when capturing an incoming link, you pass it to AppKit so it can process the request.

### How does it look without Link Mode?

### Platform specifics:

1.  Ensure that you handle incoming Universal Links in the appropriate methods of `AppDelegate` or `SceneDelegate`.
2.  Ensure that you have enabled the Associated Domains Capability in your XCode project and that your Universal Link is properly configured. _(Depending on the previous states of your Provisioning Profiles it may be necessary to update or create new ones)_

3.  Update/Create your domain’s `.well-known/apple-app-site-association` file accordingly.

For more information on how to configure universal links for your app, refer to the [Apple Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/allowing-apps-and-websites-to-link-to-your-content?language=swift).  
For a debugging guide, visit the [Debugging Universal Links](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3155-debugging-universal-links) page.  

You can check our Flutter’s AppKit sample [AppDelegate file](https://github.com/reown-com/reown_flutter/blob/master/packages/reown_appkit/example/base/ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift) as a reference.</content>

  <content>To theme the `AppKitModal` you must wrap your `MaterialApp` with a `ReownAppKitModalTheme` widget.

### Default themes

_ReownAppKitModalTheme_ already comes with 2 default themes.  
A light option: `ReownAppKitModalColors.lightMode`  
A dark option: `ReownAppKitModalColors.darkMode`.  
You can switch between them by toggling the `isDarkMode:` parameter in `ReownAppKitModalTheme` like so:

You can check [Flutter’s doc here](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/WidgetsBinding/handlePlatformBrightnessChanged.html) to know how to listen to device’s theme changes

You can define your own light and dark themes by tweaking `ReownAppKitModalThemeData` parameters. For instance, if you want to change the main foreground and background color you could do:

and pass this object to `ReownAppKitModalTheme`’s `themeData:` parameter:

### Preset theme shortcuts

`ReownAppKitModalTheme` comes with default border radiuses but you can override these values by passing your own values to `ReownAppKitModalRadiuses()` object and then adding this object to `ReownAppKitModalThemeData`’s `radiuses:` parameter.

But you can also set _no corner radiuses_ at all by setting this value to `ReownAppKitModalRadiuses.square` or _everything circular_ by using `ReownAppKitModalRadiuses.circular`

`ReownAppKitModalTheme` is an InheritedWidget so it comes with a few handy methods for you to use:

Check if the current time is dark:

Get current `ReownAppKitModalThemeData` object:

Get current `ReownAppKitModalColors` object:

You can build your own theme by creating a `ReownAppKitModalThemeData` object. _(More and easier customization options will come in the future)_</content>

  <title>Custom Networks - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/flutter/core/custom-chains</url>
  <content>Custom Networks addition and selection
--------------------------------------

AppKit Flutter supports EVM and Solana networks by default since _version 1.2.0_, meaning that you can connect to these networks with no extra configuration and it already comes with a predefined list of chains within the [ReownAppKitModalNetworks class](https://github.com/reown-com/reown_flutter/blob/develop/packages/reown_appkit/lib/modal/utils/public/appkit_modal_default_networks.dart).

This means that if you intend to support just EVM and Solana networks then no further adjustments are necessary.

However, with extra configuration to `ReownAppKitModalNetworks` and `optionalNamespaces` you can connect to whatever other network you’d like.

For instance, if you want to support also Polkadot blockchain then first add Polkadot to the supported networks list:

_Remember to do this before `ReownAppKitModal` instance configuration and to set `isTestNetwork: true` if you are adding a testnet_

Then modify/add `optionalNamespaces:` property in ReownAppKitModal instance as follows:

_When you set `optionalNamespaces` property you are overwriting the internal definition of it so it is important that you also include `eip155` and `solana` in this case. If you plan to support only EVM + Solana then this extra step is not needed as mentioned before_

`ReownAppKitModalNetworks` class also comes with handy methods to change the configuration of the supported networks list:

*   You can add more EVM networks

*   You can remove Solana networks if you don’t want to support it

*   You can remove test networks altogether

Configuration examples
----------------------

A list of different ways of configure `ReownAppKitModal()` instance to support different blockchains.

#### 1\. Default support (EVM + Solana blockchains)

#### 2\. Only EVM blockchains support

#### 3\. Only Solana blockchain support

#### 4\. Default support (EVM + Solana blockchains) + Polkadot + Tron

  <title>Verify - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/flutter/cloud/verify</url>
  <content>Verify API is a security-focused feature that allows wallets to notify end-users when they may be connecting to a suspicious or malicious domain, helping to prevent phishing attacks across the industry.

Once a wallet knows whether an end-user is on uniswap.com or eviluniswap.com, it can help them to detect potentially harmful connections through Verify’s combined offering of Reown’s domain registry.

Cloud Verification
------------------

In order to verify your app domain in Reown Cloud follow these steps:

1.  Head over to [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/)
    
2.  Create a new project or click on the project you would like to verify.
    
3.  On the settings tab, head over to the ‘Domain verification’ section and fill in the website URL that you wish to verify.
    

4.  Click on the copy button and head over to your domain Name Registrar/Provider to edit your DNS records. Alternatively, if you can’t manage DNS records for your project (eg: ENS or vercel.app) you can host a static file under `/.well-known/walletconnect.txt` which contains the entire verification code that you copied. If you are using the static file method, you can jump over step 7.
    
5.  Under `Type`, select `TXT`. In the “Answer” section, paste the text you copied from the cloud dashboard. This field may vary across DNS dashboards. If you’re trying to register a subdomain, add it under `Host`. Feel free to leave TTL at its default value.
    

6.  Depending on your DNS settings, this might take a while to reflect. You can check out DNS settings for your website with CLI tools like Dig or with websites like [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=txt)
    
7.  Once this is done and you have confirmed this change is reflected, head on back to your Cloud Dashboard and click on Verify.
    

8.  You should see a toast pop up in the bottom right section of your screen and the domain verification section should have a green tick next to it.</content>

<page>
  <title>Relay - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/flutter/cloud/relay</url>
  <content>Project ID
----------

The Project ID is consumed through URL parameters.

URL parameters used:

*   `projectId`: Your Project ID can be obtained from [cloud.reown.com](https://cloud.reown.com/)

Example URL:

`https://relay.walletconnect.com/?projectId=c4f79cc821944d9680842e34466bfbd`

This can be instantiated from the client with the `projectId` in the `SignClient` constructor.

Allowlist
---------

To help prevent malicious use of your project ID you are strongly encouraged to set an allowlist of [origins](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin) or application/bundle ids for mobile applications where the project ID is used. Requests from other origins will be denied.

*   Allowlist supports a list of origins in the format `[scheme://]<hostname[:port]`.
*   [Application ID](https://developer.android.com/build/configure-app-module#set-application-id)/[Bundle IDs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/bundle_ids) typically are defined using the [reverse domain name notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation)

Using `localhost` (or `127.0.0.1`) is always permitted, and if empty all origins are allowed. Updates take 15 minutes to apply.

If scheme or port is specified, it must match exactly. Hostname must also match exactly, but wildcards can be used for individual labels within the hostname.

Example of possible origins in the allowlist:

*   `example.com` - allows `https://example.com` or `http://example.com` but not `https://www.example.com`
*   `https://example.com` - allows `https://example.com` but not `http://example.com`
*   `https://www.example.com` - allows `https://www.example.com` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://example.com:8080` - allows `https://example.com:8080` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://*.example.com` - allows `https://www.example.com` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://*.*.example.com` - allows `https://www.subdomain.example.com` but not `https://www.example.com` or `https://example.com`
*   `https://www.*.example.com` - allows `https://www.subdomain.example.com` but not `https://www.example.com`
*   `https://www-*.example.com` - invalid; `*` must be the full label

Error Codes
-----------

| Reason | Error Code |
| --- | --- |
| Project ID doesn’t exist OR JWT is expired | 401 |
| Exists and is invalid | 403 |
| Too many requests | 1013 |

Websocket Close Codes
---------------------

| Code | Description | Reconnect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1001 | Server terminating | Yes |
| 4008 | Client stale: connected without a prior subscription and is not sending data | When needed |
| 4010 | Load Rebalancing | Yes |

Best Practices
--------------

*   Create a new `projectId` for each project. This allows for more granular control, dedicated explorer listings, and project metrics.
*   Don’t reuse a `projectId`.
*   Use the AllowList to limit unauthorized usage.
*   Avoid committing projects keys to the repo. Use env variables instead.

  <title>Options - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/unity/core/options</url>
  <content>### Explorer included wallets

Allows to set included wallets that are fetched from [WalletGuide](https://walletguide.walletconnect.network/). You can define a list of wallets ids you’d like to prioritize (order is respected). You can get these ids from the explorer link mentioned before by clicking on a copy icon of your desired wallet card.

### Explorer excluded wallets

Allows to set excluded wallets that are fetched from [WalletGuide](https://walletguide.walletconnect.network/). You can get these ids from the explorer link mentioned before by clicking on a copy icon of your desired wallet card.

### Supported Chains

Allows to set supported chains for the application. Can use predefined chain constants from `ChainConstants.Chains` or custom `Chain` objects.

### Enable Installed Wallet Detection

To enable AppKit to detect wallets installed on mobile devices, you need to make specific changes to the native side of the project.

### Fullscreen in WebGL

The default `unityInstance.SetFullscreen(1)` method enables fullscreen for the canvas node by pushing it to the [top layer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Top_layer). This causes the modal to be rendered behind the canvas, making it invisible to the user when fullscreen is enabled.

To fix this, AppKit creates a container around the canvas node and appends the modal UI to it. By requesting fullscreen on the container, the modal will always be rendered on top of the canvas.

### Redirect from Wallet to App

After a connection or request approval, most wallets attempt to redirect back to the app. To ensure reliability, particularly on iOS, it is recommended to register a custom URL scheme and provide it to AppKit.

*   [Register URL Scheme for Android](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/deep-linking-android.html)
*   [Register URL Scheme for iOS](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/deep-linking-ios.html)</content>

  <title>Usage - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/unity/core/usage</url>
  <content>After you have installed and configured AppKit, you can start using it to interact with the wallet provider and blockchain.

AppKit comes with the [Nethereum](https://nethereum.com/) and [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) integration out of the box.

To interact with EVM chains use `AppKit.Evm` (see [Actions](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/unity/core/actions#evm-actions) for more details). Internally, AppKit will use Wagmi on WebGL or Nethereum on other platforms. Nethereum is already preconfigured with RPC URL and interceptor that will route the requests between the wallet provider and RPC node.

Sending Ether
-------------

To send ether, you can use the `SendTransactionAsync` method of the `Web3.Eth` class.

This type of transaction uses the default amount of Gas 21000. Gas price is determined by the wallet provider.

Reading Blockchain State
------------------------

#### Get Ether Balance

Smart Contract Interaction
--------------------------

Use `ReadContractAsync` and `WriteContractAsync` methods of `AppKit.Evm` to interact with smart contracts. To read or write a smart contract function, you need to provide the contract address, ABI, method name, and arguments.

### Get ERC20 Token Balance

To get the balance of an ERC20 token, you need to know the contract address, ERC20 standard contract ABI, and the owner address. This operation doesn’t involve state change on the blockchain, so it’s a read-only action that doesn’t require a transaction.

### Send ERC20 Token

To send an ERC20 token, you need to know the contract address, ERC20 standard contract ABI, recipient address, and the amount of tokens to send. This operation requires a transaction and gas fees because it changes the state of the blockchain. User will need to confirm the transaction in the wallet.

Nethereum Integration
---------------------

AppKit offers deep integration with [Nethereum](https://nethereum.com/) on native platforms, with limited support on WebGL.

If you need to use Nethereum directly, you can access a preconfigured `Web3` instance from AppKit:

This `Web3` instance is preconfigured with Reown’s Blockchain API for the active chain and includes a request interceptor that routes requests between RPC node and the connected wallet (if needs signing).

Avoid caching this `Web3` instance, as it may be updated when the active chain is switched.</content>

  <title>Customization - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/unity/core/customization</url>
  <content>The AppKit uses Unity’s [UI Toolkit](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UIElements.html) system. By following this guide,you can customize the AppKit to match your game’s style, even if you have minimal or no prior knowledge of UI Toolkit.

Theming
-------

The AppKit relies heavily on [Unity Style Sheet (USS) variables](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UIE-USS-variables.html) for easy customization of various UI aspects, such as colors, spacing, border radius, and more.

### Preparation

The first step in theming the AppKit is to create a custom panel settings asset, followed by a custom theme file. Then, link them to the AppKit.

1.  In Unity Editor, right-click in the Project window and select **Create -> UI Toolkit -> Panel Settings Asset**.
2.  Right-click again in the Project window and select **Create -> UI Toolkit -> TSS Theme File**.
3.  Select the newly created Panel Settings Asset, and in the Inspector window, assign the newly created TSS Theme File to the `Theme Style Sheet` field.
4.  In the same Inspector window, set `Reference DPI` to 160. This is the recommended DPI for the AppKit, but feel free to adjust it to your needs.

5.  Open the TSS Theme File with your code editor and change the first line to:

6.  Under `Reown AppKit` prefab instance in your scene or prefab find `Modal` child object and assign the newly created `Panel Settings Asset` to the `Panel Settings` field of `UI Document` component.

Everything is set up, now you can start customizing the AppKit to match your game’s style.

### Overriding Variables

To override a variable, simply add it to your TSS Theme File and assign a new value to it. The example below changes the accent color to a shade of orange and the modal border color to a shade of gray.

You can find the list of all available variables in the [AppKit Base Theme](https://github.com/reown-com/reown-dotnet/blob/main/src/Reown.AppKit.Unity/UI%20Toolkit/AppKit%20Base%20Theme.tss) file.

### Custom Fonts

To override the default font, you need to add a custom font to your project and reference it in the TSS Theme File.

From the point of font asset management, the TextCore engine is very similar to TextMesh Pro. Please refer to the [UI Toolkit documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UIE-get-started-with-text.html) for more information.

Advanced Customization
----------------------

The AppKit follows the MVP (Model-View-Presenter) architecture, allowing you to customize the UI and behavior by replacing the default views and presenters with your own. Views load UXML layout files from the Resources folder and configure bindings. Presenters handle the business logic and communicate with the views. In some cases, presenters can build views dynamically and pass them to another view. Below are two examples showing how to customize both static UXML-based views and dynamic views.

### Dynamic View Customization

The Account view has a list of buttons at the bottom. At the moment of writing, there are only two buttons in the list: `Network` and `Disconnect`. Because in the future this list will include more buttons, some of which will depend on project configuration, the list is built dynamically inside of `AccountPresenter`. In this example we will be adding a custom button that opens OpenSea profile page of connected account.

Let’s create a custom presenter and override the method that creates the bottom buttons list.

Let’s copy the button creation code from the base presenter and modify it to create an OpenSea button.

Now we need to call `CreateOpenSeaButton` method from `CreateButtons` method. The final presenter should look like this:

The last step is to replace the default presenter with the custom one.

All screens in the AppKit modal (e.g. Account, Wallet Search, QR Code, etc.) are called `modal view`. The class that is responsible for storing, hiding, and showing the modal views is `RouterController`. To replace a modal view implementation with a custom one, you need to create a custom presenter and pass it to the `RegisterModalView` method of `RouterController`.

You can register modal views at any point in the game lifecycle. The `RouterController` will dispose of the previous presenter and replace it with the new one.

If you find that some parts of the presenter can’t be customized, please [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/reown-com/reown-dotnet/issues).

### Static View Customization

All core views in the AppKit accept optional path to the UXML layout file in the constructor.

Let’s extend the `CustomAccountPresenter` class we made in the previous example to use a custom UXML layout file. To do so, override `CreateViewInstance` method and return a new instance of `AccountView` with a custom UXML layout path.

Make sure to link original or custom USS file from your UXML layout file.

Example
-------

You can find a complete example of the customization in the [Customization](https://github.com/reown-com/reown-dotnet/tree/main/playground/Reown.Customization.Unity) example project.</content>

  <title>Smart Accounts - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/unity/core/smart-accounts</url>
  <content>Overview
--------

Smart Accounts (SAs) are enabled by default within AppKit. These accounts enhance functionality by emitting 1271 and 6492 signatures, which should be taken into account for signature verification processes, such as Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE).

### Deployment

Smart Accounts are deployed alongside the first transaction. Until deployment, a precalculated address, known as the counterfactual address, is displayed. Despite not being deployed, the account can still sign using 6492 signatures.

### Supported Networks

Smart Accounts are available on the following networks:

*   Base Sepolia
*   BSC (Binance Smart Chain)
*   Fraximal
*   Linea
*   Mode
*   Optimism
*   Polygon
*   Polygon Mumbai
*   Sepolia

### User Eligibility

Smart Accounts are exclusively available for embedded wallet users (email and social login)

FAQ
---

### What is a Smart Account?

A Smart Account improves the traditional account experience by replacing Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) with a Smart Contract that follows the [ERC-4337 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337). This opens up many use cases that were previously unavailable.

Smart Accounts do no require Private Keys or Seed Phrases, instead they rely on a key or multiple keys from designated signers to access the smart account and perform actions on chain. The keys can take multiple forms including passkeys and EOA signatures.

### What can I do with a Smart Account?

Smart accounts unlock a host of use cases that were previously unavailable with EOAs. Essentially anything that can be programmed into a smart contract can be used by Smart Accounts.

*   **Automated Transactions:** Set up recurring payments or conditional transfers.
*   **Multi-Signature Authorization:** Require multiple approvals for a transaction to increase security.
*   **Delegated Transactions:** Allow a third party to execute transactions on your behalf under specific conditions.
*   **Enhanced Security:** Implement complex security mechanisms such as time-locked transactions and withdrawal limits.
*   **Interoperability:** Interact seamlessly with decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.
*   **Custom Logic:** Create custom transaction rules and workflows that align with personal or business requirements.

### How do I get a Smart Account?

Existing AppKit Universal Wallet Users will be given the option to upgrade their account to a smart account. Once you upgrade you will still be able to access your EOA and self-custody your account.

New AppKit Universal Wallet Users will be given smart accounts by default when they login for the first time.

### Does it cost anything?

There is a small additional cost for activating your smart account. The activation fee is added to the first transaction and covers the network fees required for deploying the new smart contract onchain.

### Can I export my Smart Account?

No, you cannot export your Smart Account. The Smart Account (SA) is deployed by the EOA and is owned by the EOA. Your EOA account will always be exportable. Also is good to know that SA don’t have seedphrases.

### Can I withdraw all my funds from my Smart Account?

Yes, you can withdraw all your funds from your Smart Account.

### What are account names?

Smart account addresses start with ’0x’ followed by 42 characters, this is the unique address of your smart account on the network. ‘0x’ addresses like this are long, unwieldy and unmemorable. AppKit allows you to assign a more memorable name for your smart account using [ENS Resolvers](https://docs.ens.domains/resolvers/ccip-read).

You can assign a name to your account and this will act as an alias for your account that can be shared publicly and provide a better user experience. AppKit account names are followed by the “reown.id” domain.

### What can I do with my account name?

As AppKit smart account addresses are the same across the supported networks by [Pimlico](https://docs.pimlico.io/infra/platform/supported-chains), you only need one account name which can then be used across the networks.

For example if you want someone to send you USDC on Polygon they can send it to “johnsmith.reown.id”. If you want someone wants to send you USDC on Optimism they can also use “johnsmith.reown.id”.</content>

  <title>Verify - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/unity/cloud/verify</url>
  <content>Verify API is a security-focused feature that allows wallets to notify end-users when they may be connecting to a suspicious or malicious domain, helping to prevent phishing attacks across the industry.

Once a wallet knows whether an end-user is on uniswap.com or eviluniswap.com, it can help them to detect potentially harmful connections through Verify’s combined offering of Reown’s domain registry.

Cloud Verification
------------------

In order to verify your app domain in Reown Cloud follow these steps:

1.  Head over to [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/)
    
2.  Create a new project or click on the project you would like to verify.
    
3.  On the settings tab, head over to the ‘Domain verification’ section and fill in the website URL that you wish to verify.
    

4.  Click on the copy button and head over to your domain Name Registrar/Provider to edit your DNS records. Alternatively, if you can’t manage DNS records for your project (eg: ENS or vercel.app) you can host a static file under `/.well-known/walletconnect.txt` which contains the entire verification code that you copied. If you are using the static file method, you can jump over step 7.
    
5.  Under `Type`, select `TXT`. In the “Answer” section, paste the text you copied from the cloud dashboard. This field may vary across DNS dashboards. If you’re trying to register a subdomain, add it under `Host`. Feel free to leave TTL at its default value.
    

6.  Depending on your DNS settings, this might take a while to reflect. You can check out DNS settings for your website with CLI tools like Dig or with websites like [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=txt)
    
7.  Once this is done and you have confirmed this change is reflected, head on back to your Cloud Dashboard and click on Verify.
    

8.  You should see a toast pop up in the bottom right section of your screen and the domain verification section should have a green tick next to it.</content>

<page>
  <title>Relay - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/unity/cloud/relay</url>
  <content>Project ID
----------

The Project ID is consumed through URL parameters.

URL parameters used:

*   `projectId`: Your Project ID can be obtained from [cloud.reown.com](https://cloud.reown.com/)

Example URL:

`https://relay.walletconnect.com/?projectId=c4f79cc821944d9680842e34466bfbd`

This can be instantiated from the client with the `projectId` in the `SignClient` constructor.

Allowlist
---------

To help prevent malicious use of your project ID you are strongly encouraged to set an allowlist of [origins](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin) or application/bundle ids for mobile applications where the project ID is used. Requests from other origins will be denied.

*   Allowlist supports a list of origins in the format `[scheme://]<hostname[:port]`.
*   [Application ID](https://developer.android.com/build/configure-app-module#set-application-id)/[Bundle IDs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/bundle_ids) typically are defined using the [reverse domain name notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation)

Using `localhost` (or `127.0.0.1`) is always permitted, and if empty all origins are allowed. Updates take 15 minutes to apply.

If scheme or port is specified, it must match exactly. Hostname must also match exactly, but wildcards can be used for individual labels within the hostname.

Example of possible origins in the allowlist:

*   `example.com` - allows `https://example.com` or `http://example.com` but not `https://www.example.com`
*   `https://example.com` - allows `https://example.com` but not `http://example.com`
*   `https://www.example.com` - allows `https://www.example.com` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://example.com:8080` - allows `https://example.com:8080` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://*.example.com` - allows `https://www.example.com` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://*.*.example.com` - allows `https://www.subdomain.example.com` but not `https://www.example.com` or `https://example.com`
*   `https://www.*.example.com` - allows `https://www.subdomain.example.com` but not `https://www.example.com`
*   `https://www-*.example.com` - invalid; `*` must be the full label

Error Codes
-----------

| Reason | Error Code |
| --- | --- |
| Project ID doesn’t exist OR JWT is expired | 401 |
| Exists and is invalid | 403 |
| Too many requests | 1013 |

Websocket Close Codes
---------------------

| Code | Description | Reconnect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1001 | Server terminating | Yes |
| 4008 | Client stale: connected without a prior subscription and is not sending data | When needed |
| 4010 | Load Rebalancing | Yes |

Best Practices
--------------

*   Create a new `projectId` for each project. This allows for more granular control, dedicated explorer listings, and project metrics.
*   Don’t reuse a `projectId`.
*   Use the AllowList to limit unauthorized usage.
*   Avoid committing projects keys to the repo. Use env variables instead.

  <title>Smart Accounts - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/javascript/core/smart-accounts</url>
  <content>Overview
--------

Smart Accounts (SAs) are enabled by default within AppKit. These accounts enhance functionality by emitting 1271 and 6492 signatures, which should be taken into account for signature verification processes, such as Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE).

### Deployment

Smart Accounts are deployed alongside the first transaction. Until deployment, a precalculated address, known as the counterfactual address, is displayed. Despite not being deployed, the account can still sign using 6492 signatures.

### Supported Networks

Smart Accounts are available on the following networks:

*   Base Sepolia
*   BSC (Binance Smart Chain)
*   Fraximal
*   Linea
*   Mode
*   Optimism
*   Polygon
*   Polygon Mumbai
*   Sepolia

### User Eligibility

Smart Accounts are exclusively available for embedded wallet users (email and social login)

FAQ
---

### What is a Smart Account?

A Smart Account improves the traditional account experience by replacing Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) with a Smart Contract that follows the [ERC-4337 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337). This opens up many use cases that were previously unavailable.

Smart Accounts do no require Private Keys or Seed Phrases, instead they rely on a key or multiple keys from designated signers to access the smart account and perform actions on chain. The keys can take multiple forms including passkeys and EOA signatures.

### What can I do with a Smart Account?

Smart accounts unlock a host of use cases that were previously unavailable with EOAs. Essentially anything that can be programmed into a smart contract can be used by Smart Accounts.

*   **Automated Transactions:** Set up recurring payments or conditional transfers.
*   **Multi-Signature Authorization:** Require multiple approvals for a transaction to increase security.
*   **Delegated Transactions:** Allow a third party to execute transactions on your behalf under specific conditions.
*   **Enhanced Security:** Implement complex security mechanisms such as time-locked transactions and withdrawal limits.
*   **Interoperability:** Interact seamlessly with decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.
*   **Custom Logic:** Create custom transaction rules and workflows that align with personal or business requirements.

### How do I get a Smart Account?

Existing AppKit Universal Wallet Users will be given the option to upgrade their account to a smart account. Once you upgrade you will still be able to access your EOA and self-custody your account.

New AppKit Universal Wallet Users will be given smart accounts by default when they login for the first time.

### Does it cost anything?

There is a small additional cost for activating your smart account. The activation fee is added to the first transaction and covers the network fees required for deploying the new smart contract onchain.

### Can I export my Smart Account?

No, you cannot export your Smart Account. The Smart Account (SA) is deployed by the EOA and is owned by the EOA. Your EOA account will always be exportable. Also is good to know that SA don’t have seedphrases.

### Can I withdraw all my funds from my Smart Account?

Yes, you can withdraw all your funds from your Smart Account.

### What are account names?

Smart account addresses start with ’0x’ followed by 42 characters, this is the unique address of your smart account on the network. ‘0x’ addresses like this are long, unwieldy and unmemorable. AppKit allows you to assign a more memorable name for your smart account using [ENS Resolvers](https://docs.ens.domains/resolvers/ccip-read).

You can assign a name to your account and this will act as an alias for your account that can be shared publicly and provide a better user experience. AppKit account names are followed by the “reown.id” domain.

  <title>Custom connectors - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/javascript/core/custom-connectors</url>
  <content>If you already have Wagmi integrated into your application or would like more control over Wagmi’s configuration, you can integrate AppKit on top of it.

Adding custom connectors like WalletConnect and Coinbase is optional.

By default, [EIP-6963](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963) and WC connectors are provided out of the box.

    import { createAppKit } from '@reown/appkit'
    import { WagmiAdapter } from '@reown/appkit-adapter-wagmi'
    import { reconnect, http, createConfig } from '@wagmi/core'
    import { CreateConnectorFn } from 'wagmi'
    import { sepolia } from '@reown/appkit/networks'
    import { walletConnect, coinbaseWallet, injected } from 'wagmi/connectors'
    
    const projectId = 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID'
    
    const metadata = {
      //...
    }
    
    // create the connectors (delete the ones you don't need)
    const connectors: CreateConnectorFn[] = []
    connectors.push(walletConnect({ projectId, metadata, showQrModal: false })) // showQrModal must be false
    connectors.push(injected({ shimDisconnect: true }))
    connectors.push(
      coinbaseWallet({
        appName: metadata.name,
        appLogoUrl: metadata.icons[0]
      })
    )
    
    export const networks = [sepolia]
    
    export const wagmiAdapter = new WagmiAdapter({
      storage:
      transports: {
        [sepolia.id]: http()
      },
      connectors,
      projectId,
      networks
    })
    
    export const config = wagmiAdapter.wagmiConfig
    
    createAppKit({
      adapters: [wagmiAdapter],
      projectId,
      networks: [sepolia]
    })
    

Add custom wallet adapters for Solana wallets by first installing the wallet adapter package and then including the adapters in the wallets array. You can find a more Solana wallet adapters [here](https://github.com/anza-xyz/wallet-adapter/tree/master/packages/wallets).

    npm install @solana/wallet-adapter-wallets
    

    import { createAppKit } from "@reown/appkit";
    import { SolanaAdapter } from "@reown/appkit-adapter-solana";
    import { solana, solanaTestnet, solanaDevnet } from "@reown/appkit/networks";
    
    import {
      SolflareWalletAdapter,
      PhantomWalletAdapter,
    } from "@solana/wallet-adapter-wallets";
    
    // 0. Set up Solana adapter
    const solanaWeb3JsAdapter = new SolanaAdapter({
      wallets: [new PhantomWalletAdapter(), new SolflareWalletAdapter()],
    });
    
    // 1. Get projectId from https://cloud.reown.com
    const projectId = "YOUR_PROJECT_ID";
    
    // 2. Set up the metadata
    const metadata = {
      //...
    };
    
    // 3. Create modal
    const modal = createAppkit({
      adapters: [solanaWeb3JsAdapter],
      networks: [solana, solanaTestnet, solanaDevnet],
      metadata: metadata,
      projectId,
      features: {
        analytics: true,
      },
    });</content>

| `HIDE` | Removes the “All Wallets” button from AppKit. |
| `ONLY_MOBILE` | Shows the “All Wallets” button on AppKit only on mobile. |

includeWalletIds & excludeWalletIds
-----------------------------------

### includeWalletIds

Override default recommended wallets that are fetched from [WalletGuide](https://walletguide.walletconnect.network/). Array of wallet ids defined will be shown (order is respected). Unlike `featuredWalletIds`, these wallets will be the **only** ones shown in `All Wallets` view and as recommended wallets. You can find the wallets IDs in our [Wallets List](https://docs.reown.com/cloud/wallets/wallet-list).

### excludeWalletIds

Exclude wallets that are fetched from [WalletGuide](https://walletguide.walletconnect.network/). Array of wallet ids defined will be excluded. All other wallets will be shown in respective places. You can find the wallets IDs in our [Wallets List](https://docs.reown.com/cloud/wallets/wallet-list).

### Coinbase Smart Wallet

The Coinbase connector now includes a new flag to customize the Smart Wallet behavior.

The `preference` (or `coinbasePreference`) flag accepts one of the following string values:

*   `eoaOnly`: Uses EOA Browser Extension or Mobile Coinbase Wallet.
*   `smartWalletOnly`: Displays Smart Wallet popup.
*   `all` (default): Supports both `eoaOnly` and `smartWalletOnly` based on context.

AppKit can be configured in **two** different ways: **Default** or **Custom**

Select your preferred configuration mode below:

Learn more about the Coinbase connector in the [Wagmi documentation](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/connectors/coinbaseWallet#preference).

customRpcUrls
-------------

This function allows you to add custom RPC URLs to override the default network RPC URLs for native RPC calls. This is useful when you want to use your own RPC endpoints instead of the defaults.

If you are using the Wagmi adapter, you need to pass the same `customRpcUrls` configuration to both the `WagmiAdapter` and `createAppKit`.

universalProviderConfigOverride
-------------------------------

Lets you customize specific aspects of the provider’s behavior.

You can override any of the following properties:

*   `methods`: Custom RPC methods for each namespace
*   `chains`: Supported chains for each namespace
*   `events`: Events to subscribe to for each namespace
*   `rpcMap`: Custom RPC URLs for specific chains
*   `defaultChain`: The default chain to connect to</content>

  <title>Custom networks - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/javascript/core/custom-networks</url>
  <content>If you cannot find the network you are looking for within the `@reown/appkit/networks` path, you can always add a custom network.

Since AppKit v1.1.0, there are two ways to add your network to AppKit:

### 1\. Adding Your Chain to Viem’s Directory (Recommended)

Reown AppKit use Viem to provide EVM chains to users under the hood. If your chain is EVM-compatible, it is recommended to open a PR to Viem to add your network to Viem’s directory. Once your chain is accepted by Viem, it will automatically be available in AppKit with no additional steps required.

**Here is the documentation of how to add new chain to Viem:** [https://github.com/wevm/viem/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#chains](https://github.com/wevm/viem/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#chains)

### 2\. Creating a Custom Chain Object

You can also create a custom network object without waiting for approval from Viem’s repository.

**Required Information**

You will need the following values to create a custom network:

*   **id**: Chain ID of the network.
*   **name**: Name of the network.
*   **caipNetworkId**: CAIP-2 compliant network ID.
*   **chainNamespace**: Chain namespace.
*   **nativeCurrency**: Native currency of the network.
*   **rpcUrls**: Object containing the RPC URLs for the network.
*   **blockExplorers**: Object containing the block explorers for the network.</content>

  <title>SIWX - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/javascript/core/siwx</url>
  <content>Sign In With X
--------------

Introduction
------------

The **Sign In With X** feature enables decentralized applications (Dapps) to authenticate users seamlessly across multiple blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, Polygon or Solana. This feature allows developers using our SDK to implement authentication by having users sign a unique string message with their blockchain wallets. The **Sign In With X** feature is designed in accordance with the [CAIP-122](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/main/CAIPs/caip-122.md) standard, which establishes a chain-agnostic framework for blockchain-based authentication and authorization on off-chain services.

  
[

Try Demo
--------



](https://appkit-lab.reown.com/library/siwx-default/)  

Getting Started
---------------

**SIWX** works as a plugin system for AppKit and you are going to add the plugin in the AppKit configuration. There are some ways to implement the **SIWX** feature:

*   Use the default implementation provided by AppKit
*   Use Cloud Auth SIWX to manage the sessions in the Cloud Dashboard
*   Create a custom implementation to suit your specific requirements.

To initialize the **SIWX** feature, you need to add the `siwx` parameter to the `createAppKit` function.

### Default Implementation

By using the default implementation, you can quickly integrate the **SIWX** feature into your Dapp. The default implementation provides a set of pre-built components that allow you to have the feature up and running in no time.

Read more about the [Default Implementation](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/javascript/core/siwx-default).

### Cloud Auth Implementation

The Cloud Auth SIWX is a predefined implementation of the SIWX configuration plugin that uses the Cloud service to create and manage SIWX messages and sessions. With Cloud Auth SIWX, you will be able to see and control the sessions of your users using the [User Management Dashboard](https://docs.reown.com/cloud/user-management).

Read more about the [Cloud Auth Implementation](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/javascript/core/siwx-cloud-auth).

### Custom Implementation

The `siwx` param expects to receive a defined interface from which you are able to create your own implementation. This is what allows you to customize the feature to suit your specific requirements.

The defined interface must follow specific rules to make sure that AppKit can interact with it correctly. Read more about how to have your [Custom Implementation](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/javascript/core/siwx-custom).

SIWX Expected Behavior
----------------------

*   **SIWX** will prompt to get the user signature and verify his identity every time a connection happen;
*   In case a SIWX session is already stored, the user will be automatically signed in and the prompt step will be skipped;
*   If the user changes the connected network, **SIWX** will prompt to get the user signature and verify his identity again;
*   If the user disconnects from the Dapp, **SIWX** will revoke the session and the user will need to sign in again.

Migrating from SIWE to SIWX
---------------------------

If you are currently already using **SIWE** from `@reown/appkit-siwe`, after AppKit version 1.5.0, you will be migrated into **SIWX**. The migration process is automatic and your `siweConfig` from `createAppKit` function will be mapped internally.</content>

  <title>Sending with Cloud - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/javascript/notifications/cloud-sending</url>
  <content>You can send notifications to subscribed users easily in [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/). Sending to users involves targeting particular [notification types](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/javascript/notifications/cloud-setup#notification-types) who will receive your notification if they have not opted-out. You can specify a title and body for the notification, as well as a call-to-action link which users will be taken to when clicking on the notification.

Users can subscribe to your app in [several places](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/javascript/notifications/overview#subscribing-and-receiving-notifications) including the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/), in your app with our [frontend SDK](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/javascript/notifications/frontend-integration/usage), or in supporting wallets.

To send notifications, you can use the utility provided in [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/) under the Notify API section:

1.  In the APIs tab of your project, navigate to the Notify API section. You should see a banner with a link to the Send Notification playground.
    
2.  This allows you to send notifications to your subscribers. After you select the associated project, you can select the notification type, title, body, and link to send to your subscribers.</content>

  <title>Smart Sessions - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/javascript/early-access/smart-session</url>
  <content>Overview
--------

Smart Sessions allow developers to easily integrate session-based permission handling within their decentralized applications (dApps). Using the `grantPermissions` method, can send permission requests to wallets.

For users, this means a simpler experience. Instead of approving every action individually, they can allow access for a single session, making it faster and easier to use apps without dealing with constant pop-ups or interruptions.

With Smart Sessions, approved actions are carried out by the app’s backend during the session. This allows transactions to be processed automatically, making the experience even more seamless while ensuring that everything stays within the permissions set by the user.

This guide will walk you through on how to use the `grantPermissions` method, including the basic setup and an example of how to request permissions from a wallet.

Implementations
---------------

The `grantPermissions` method provides an easy way to interact with the smart wallet to request permissions.

### Step 1 | Install the library

### Step 2 | Import the method

First, import the grantPermissions method from the `@reown/appkit-experimental/smart-session` package.

### Step 3 | Define the Permission Request

Create an object adhering to the `SmartSessionGrantPermissionsRequest` type. This object specifies details like the `address`, `chainID`, `signer`, `policies`, `permissions`, and `expiry` time.

Example request object:

### Step 4 | Invoke the Method

Call the `grantPermissions` function, passing the request object. This will trigger the permission request via the connected wallet.

### Step 5 | Handle the Response

Upon successful execution, the response will include the granted permissions and the session context. So the response can be handled as needed.

#### Response Format

How to use the permissions
--------------------------

The dApp must call the following two endpoints from the wallet services API to use these permissions.

1.  `https://rpc.walletconnect.org/v1/wallets/prepareCalls` - Accepts an EIP-5792 `wallet_sendCalls` request. Responds with the prepared calls (in the case of Appkit Embedded Wallet, an Entrypoint v0.7 user operation), some context, and a signature request.
2.  `https://rpc.walletconnect.org/v1/wallets/sendPreparedCalls` - Accepts prepared calls, a signature, and the context returned from prepareCalls if present. Returns an EIP-5792 calls ID.

### Steps to follow for executing any async action by the dApp backend.

1.  Dapp makes the `wallet_prepareCalls` JSON RPC call to the wallet service API. Accepts an EIP-5792 `wallet_sendCalls` request, and returns the prepared calls according to the account’s implementation.
    
    #### Parameter
    

#### Return value

2.  App developers are expected to Sign the `signatureRequest.hash` returned from `wallet_prepareCalls` call using the dApp key (secp256k1 or secp256r1)
    
3.  dApps makes the `wallet_sendPreparedCalls` JSON RPC call to wallet service API. The RPC accepts the prepared response from `wallet_prepareCalls` request along with a signature, and returns an [EIP-5792](https://eip.tools/eip/5792) call bundle ID.

  <title>Cloud Setup - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/javascript/notifications/cloud-setup</url>
  <content>This page explains the configuration required in order to obtain a Notify API Secret and configure your project to send notifications.

For a quick start to experiment with, you can try the [web3inbox template](https://github.com/WalletConnect/web3inbox-client/tree/main/apps/web) and following the steps in the README.

Domain to use
-------------

It is important to understand what domain you are using for your project as you are required to host a static file (the `did.json` file) on this domain before being able to use Notify API. The [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/) and clients receiving and managing your notifications use this file to authenticate that your domain is associated with the source of the notifications.

You can pick 1 domain and this is configured in the Dapp URL field of the Notify API section of the [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/). You may change your domain at any time, as long as you properly host the new `did.json` file there. Note that only one project may use a given domain at the same time.

During development it is optional to use your production domain for testing. Instead, you can use a staging domain, or even a entirely separate domain e.g. Vercel test site. However, once you move to production you will need to update your domain to your production domain and host a new file there.

Note that the file must be hosted on a real, publicly accessible, domain in order to verify its legitimacy. The use of `localhost` or other local addresses is not allowed.

Dapp name, description, and logo
--------------------------------

The dapp name, description, and logo are displayed in wallets that integrate Notify API as well as in the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/). These details should be provided for the best user experience and to help the user identify your app.

Notification types
------------------

Notification types are an important feature of Notify API and are a way for a user to have control over what types of notifications they receive. Users can change their notification types at any time in your app, their wallet, or the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/). When sending notifications, you must use one of these configured notification types which you reference in code by its UUID.

Notification types are configured with a name, description, and icon which allow the user understand what types of notifications they would receive for that type. When a user receives a push notification on their device, they will see the icon that is configured with the notification type. Examples of notification types may include “Account updates” or “Service updates”.

Setup steps
-----------

### Navigating to Notify API section

In [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/), navigate to the APIs tab of your project.

### Configuring Notify API

Under Notify API > Configuration > `DAPP INFORMATION`, fill in the Dapp URL field. This is the domain of your app that you will use to publish notifications.

### Adding Notification Image and Types

Under the same section, next to Notification types, click on the “Add Notification Type” button and add a title, notification image and description for your notification type. This is the type of notification that your app will publish.

For example, if you are going to send promotional content as notification, you might want to add a notification type called “Promotional” with a description “Promotional content from the XYZ Team.”. You can also add a relevant image for the notification type.

### Saving Changes

Optionally, you can add a logo and description for your project. This will be shown to users when they subscribe to your app. Click “Save” to save your changes.

### Notify Secret

Take note of your new Notify API Secret. You will need this to publish notifications. This secret allows publishing notifications to any account subscribed to your app, so should not be published and should only be used by your app backend.

### Hosting did.json file

Next, you will need to host `did.json` file on this page at the `/.well-known/` directory of your public URL. Please also ensure that your application has CORS enabled. An example is linked [here.](https://github.com/WalletConnect/gm-dapp/blob/main/next.config.js)

*   Download `did.json` (click on `DID:WEB` section to show the download button ) and host it at, for example, `https://app.example.com/.well-known/did.json`

### Enabling Welcome Notifications

Welcome Notifications are notifications that are sent to users when they subscribe to your app. This is a great way to welcome users to your app and explain what types of notifications they will receive.

To enable Welcome Notifications, switch on the toggle in the Welcome Notifications section of your Reown Cloud project after adding relevant Notification Type, Title, Body & Link.

### Enabling Notify API

Once all changes have been saved and the `did.json` file has been deployed successfully, switch on the toggle switch in the Notify API section of your Reown Cloud project. If everything is configured correctly, you should see a success toast: “Notify configuration successfully verified”

Send Notifications in Cloud
---------------------------

Once you have completed the setup steps, you can now send notifications to users who have subscribed to your app. [Read more](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/javascript/notifications/cloud-sending)

Next steps
----------

1.  Now you are ready for accounts to subscribe to your app and send notifications to them using your Notify API Secret or with Reown Cloud.

2.  If you haven’t already, [verify your apps domain](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/javascript/cloud/verify) for improved security.
    
3.  Navigate to the `Metrics` tab and select Web3Inbox from the dropdown to access analytics for your app. [Learn more about Web3Inbox Analytics](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/javascript/cloud/analytics#web3inbox).</content>
</page>

<page>
  <title>Backend Integration - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/javascript/notifications/backend-integration</url>
  <content>Once an account is subscribed to your app’s notifications you can test sending notifications to the account. You can subscribe in your app directly with our [Frontend Integration](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/javascript/notifications/frontend-integration/usage), or with one of the below testing options.

We recommend testing notifications with the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/) which supports push notifications and can be installed to your phone. You can also try one of our sample wallets:

*   [iOS sample wallet](https://testflight.apple.com/join/09bTAryp)
*   [Android sample wallet](https://appdistribution.firebase.dev/i/d2c86e879abd5a86)

Authentication
--------------

To send notifications and access all subscriber information for your dapp, you will need your Notify API Secret and project ID.

You can find the Notify API Secret under the Notify API section of the APIs tab of your project on [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/). Follow steps on the [Cloud Setup](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/javascript/notifications/cloud-setup) page to configure this. This secret allows publishing notifications to any account subscribed to your app, so should not be published and should only be used by your app backend.

Sending notifications
---------------------

Only plaintext is supported, and newlines are ignored.

To send a notification notification you can call the `/notify` endpoint. This endpoint supports the following fields:

*   `type` - The Notification type ID copied from Reown Cloud.
*   `title` - The title of the notification. Max 64 characters.
*   `body` - The body of the notification containing more detail. Max 255 characters.
*   `url` (optional) - A URL attached to the notification that the user can navigate to. Max 255 characters.
*   `accounts` - A list of [CAIP-10](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/main/CAIPs/caip-10.md) account IDs for which to send the notification to. Max 500 accounts per request. Also see the [rate limits](https://docs.reown.com/_sites/docs.reown.com/appkit/javascript/notifications/backend-integration#rate-limits) below.
*   `notification_id` (optional) - An idempotency key of arbitrary format used to dedup multiple requests. Max 255 characters. Multiple calls with the same `notification_id` will use the first call’s `notification` content, but will send to any additional account IDs listed in `accounts`.

Example usage:

Get subscribers
---------------

You can tell if an account is subscribed and get information about subscribers using the `/v1/<project-id>/subscribers` endpoint. You can provide up to 100 accounts in the request.

If the account is subscribed, it will be returned as a key in the response along with a list of subscribed notification types as the value. If the account is not a subscriber, it will not be returned in the response.

Example usage:

Example response:

Get all subscribers
-------------------

You can get a list of all of the currently-subscribed accounts by calling the `/<project-id>/subscribers` endpoint.

Example usage:

Mark all notifications as read
------------------------------

Unless marked as read by an app frontend, notifications will always be “unread”. Because of this, when you initially add support for displaying unread status or unread count to your frontend, users that have received notifications in the past will have notifications display as “unread” even if they already have seen them. This can potentially be an undesirable user experience.

To mitigate this problem, you can make a one-time call to the `/v1/<project-id>/mark-all-as-read` API endpoint which will mark all existing notifications as read. Notifications marked as read in this way will not contribute to read rate analytics. After you deploy your integration of unread states, you can call this endpoint to reset the unread state for all of your existing notifications.

Rate limits
-----------

To protect our system and subscribers, various limits and rate limits are in-place.

Rate limits are implemented as [token bucket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket) and contain both rate and burst amounts. On average, a rate of requests can be made. However, since real-world applications often make requests in bursts, this fixed rate can be surpassed temporarily up to the burst amount, provided the app subsequently makes requests below the average in order to recover its bursting capability.

*   `POST /<project-id>/notify`:
    *   Each app can send 2 notifications per hour to an account, with a burst up to 50. Accounts that have been rate limited will be returned in the request response. Exceptions may be made on a per-project basis for special circumstances.
    *   Each app can call this endpoint 2 times per second with a burst up to 20. Rate limited requests will return a 429 status code.
*   `POST /v1/<project-id>/subscribers`
    *   Each app can call this endpoint 100 times per second with a burst up to 100. Rate limited requests will return a 429 status code.
*   `GET /<project-id>/subscribers`
    *   Each app can call this endpoint 1 time every 5 minutes with a burst up to 2. Rate limited requests will return a 429 status code.
*   `POST /v1/<project-id>/mark-all-as-read`
    *   Each app can call this endpoint 1 time per hour with a burst up to 5. Rate limited requests will return a 429 status code.</content>

  <content>Try Web3Inbox
-------------

The fastest way to try Web3Inbox is to go to [app.web3inbox.com](https://app.web3inbox.com/) and try subscribing to some dapps. The [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/) is a universal inbox for web3 users to access all their notifications in one place.

*   [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/)

Or access the repo at [github.com/WalletConnect/web3inbox](https://github.com/WalletConnect/web3inbox/).

Native notifications
--------------------

Web3Inbox also supports native notifications on iOS and Android. To try native notifications, you can use the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/) and subscribe to dapps or build one of our sample apps.

A wallet that supports Notify is required to receive notifications.

Wallet notifications
--------------------

To try wallet notifications on a iOS or Android device, use a wallet that supports Notify. Alternatively, try building one of our sample apps, or grab a sample wallet preview build from Testflight or Firebase.

  <title>Verify - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/javascript/cloud/verify</url>
  <content>Verify API is a security-focused feature that allows wallets to notify end-users when they may be connecting to a suspicious or malicious domain, helping to prevent phishing attacks across the industry.

Once a wallet knows whether an end-user is on uniswap.com or eviluniswap.com, it can help them to detect potentially harmful connections through Verify’s combined offering of Reown’s domain registry.

Cloud Verification
------------------

In order to verify your app domain in Reown Cloud follow these steps:

1.  Head over to [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/)
    
2.  Create a new project or click on the project you would like to verify.
    
3.  On the settings tab, head over to the ‘Domain verification’ section and fill in the website URL that you wish to verify.
    

4.  Click on the copy button and head over to your domain Name Registrar/Provider to edit your DNS records. Alternatively, if you can’t manage DNS records for your project (eg: ENS or vercel.app) you can host a static file under `/.well-known/walletconnect.txt` which contains the entire verification code that you copied. If you are using the static file method, you can jump over step 7.
    
5.  Under `Type`, select `TXT`. In the “Answer” section, paste the text you copied from the cloud dashboard. This field may vary across DNS dashboards. If you’re trying to register a subdomain, add it under `Host`. Feel free to leave TTL at its default value.
    

6.  Depending on your DNS settings, this might take a while to reflect. You can check out DNS settings for your website with CLI tools like Dig or with websites like [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=txt)
    
7.  Once this is done and you have confirmed this change is reflected, head on back to your Cloud Dashboard and click on Verify.
    

8.  You should see a toast pop up in the bottom right section of your screen and the domain verification section should have a green tick next to it.</content>

The Project ID is consumed through URL parameters.

URL parameters used:

*   `projectId`: Your Project ID can be obtained from [cloud.reown.com](https://cloud.reown.com/)

Example URL:

`https://relay.walletconnect.com/?projectId=c4f79cc821944d9680842e34466bfbd`

This can be instantiated from the client with the `projectId` in the `SignClient` constructor.

Allowlist
---------

To help prevent malicious use of your project ID you are strongly encouraged to set an allowlist of [origins](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin) or application/bundle ids for mobile applications where the project ID is used. Requests from other origins will be denied.

*   Allowlist supports a list of origins in the format `[scheme://]<hostname[:port]`.
*   [Application ID](https://developer.android.com/build/configure-app-module#set-application-id)/[Bundle IDs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/bundle_ids) typically are defined using the [reverse domain name notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation)

Using `localhost` (or `127.0.0.1`) is always permitted, and if empty all origins are allowed. Updates take 15 minutes to apply.

If scheme or port is specified, it must match exactly. Hostname must also match exactly, but wildcards can be used for individual labels within the hostname.

Example of possible origins in the allowlist:

*   `example.com` - allows `https://example.com` or `http://example.com` but not `https://www.example.com`
*   `https://example.com` - allows `https://example.com` but not `http://example.com`
*   `https://www.example.com` - allows `https://www.example.com` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://example.com:8080` - allows `https://example.com:8080` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://*.example.com` - allows `https://www.example.com` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://*.*.example.com` - allows `https://www.subdomain.example.com` but not `https://www.example.com` or `https://example.com`
*   `https://www.*.example.com` - allows `https://www.subdomain.example.com` but not `https://www.example.com`
*   `https://www-*.example.com` - invalid; `*` must be the full label

Error Codes
-----------

| Reason | Error Code |
| --- | --- |
| Project ID doesn’t exist OR JWT is expired | 401 |
| Exists and is invalid | 403 |
| Too many requests | 1013 |

Websocket Close Codes
---------------------

| Code | Description | Reconnect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1001 | Server terminating | Yes |
| 4008 | Client stale: connected without a prior subscription and is not sending data | When needed |
| 4010 | Load Rebalancing | Yes |

Best Practices
--------------

*   Create a new `projectId` for each project. This allows for more granular control, dedicated explorer listings, and project metrics.
*   Don’t reuse a `projectId`.
*   Use the AllowList to limit unauthorized usage.
*   Avoid committing projects keys to the repo. Use env variables instead.

  <title>Smart Accounts - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react-native/core/smart-accounts</url>
  <content>Overview
--------

Smart Accounts (SAs) are enabled by default within AppKit. These accounts enhance functionality by emitting 1271 and 6492 signatures, which should be taken into account for signature verification processes, such as Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE).

### Deployment

Smart Accounts are deployed alongside the first transaction. Until deployment, a precalculated address, known as the counterfactual address, is displayed. Despite not being deployed, the account can still sign using 6492 signatures.

### Supported Networks

Smart Accounts are available on the following networks:

*   Base Sepolia
*   BSC (Binance Smart Chain)
*   Fraximal
*   Linea
*   Mode
*   Optimism
*   Polygon
*   Polygon Mumbai
*   Sepolia

### User Eligibility

Smart Accounts are exclusively available for embedded wallet users (email and social login)

FAQ
---

### What is a Smart Account?

A Smart Account improves the traditional account experience by replacing Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) with a Smart Contract that follows the [ERC-4337 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337). This opens up many use cases that were previously unavailable.

Smart Accounts do no require Private Keys or Seed Phrases, instead they rely on a key or multiple keys from designated signers to access the smart account and perform actions on chain. The keys can take multiple forms including passkeys and EOA signatures.

### What can I do with a Smart Account?

Smart accounts unlock a host of use cases that were previously unavailable with EOAs. Essentially anything that can be programmed into a smart contract can be used by Smart Accounts.

*   **Automated Transactions:** Set up recurring payments or conditional transfers.
*   **Multi-Signature Authorization:** Require multiple approvals for a transaction to increase security.
*   **Delegated Transactions:** Allow a third party to execute transactions on your behalf under specific conditions.
*   **Enhanced Security:** Implement complex security mechanisms such as time-locked transactions and withdrawal limits.
*   **Interoperability:** Interact seamlessly with decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.
*   **Custom Logic:** Create custom transaction rules and workflows that align with personal or business requirements.

### How do I get a Smart Account?

Existing AppKit Universal Wallet Users will be given the option to upgrade their account to a smart account. Once you upgrade you will still be able to access your EOA and self-custody your account.

New AppKit Universal Wallet Users will be given smart accounts by default when they login for the first time.

### Does it cost anything?

There is a small additional cost for activating your smart account. The activation fee is added to the first transaction and covers the network fees required for deploying the new smart contract onchain.

### Can I export my Smart Account?

No, you cannot export your Smart Account. The Smart Account (SA) is deployed by the EOA and is owned by the EOA. Your EOA account will always be exportable. Also is good to know that SA don’t have seedphrases.

### Can I withdraw all my funds from my Smart Account?

Yes, you can withdraw all your funds from your Smart Account.

### What are account names?

Smart account addresses start with ’0x’ followed by 42 characters, this is the unique address of your smart account on the network. ‘0x’ addresses like this are long, unwieldy and unmemorable. AppKit allows you to assign a more memorable name for your smart account using [ENS Resolvers](https://docs.ens.domains/resolvers/ccip-read).

You can assign a name to your account and this will act as an alias for your account that can be shared publicly and provide a better user experience. AppKit account names are followed by the “reown.id” domain.

### What can I do with my account name?

As AppKit smart account addresses are the same across the supported networks by [Pimlico](https://docs.pimlico.io/infra/platform/supported-chains), you only need one account name which can then be used across the networks.

For example if you want someone to send you USDC on Polygon they can send it to “johnsmith.reown.id”. If you want someone wants to send you USDC on Optimism they can also use “johnsmith.reown.id”.</content>

  <title>Link Mode - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react-native/core/link-mode</url>
  <content>AppKit Link Mode is a low latency mechanism for transporting One-Click Auth requests and session requests over universal links, reducing the need for a WebSocket connection with the Relay. This significantly enhances the user experience when connecting native dApps to native wallets by reducing the latency associated with networking connections, especially when the user has an unstable internet connection.

### How to enable it:

To support link mode add a universal link for your dapp in Cloud project configuration [dashboard](https://cloud.reown.com/sign-in), configure your Metadata with a valid universal link and set the `linkMode` property to `true`:

### How does it look without Link Mode?

### Platform specifics:

To enable universal links for your app, refer to [React Native Documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/linking?syntax=ios#enabling-deep-links).  

After following the steps provided in the official guide:

1.  Ensure that you handle incoming Universal Links in the your `AppDelegate.mm` file.

2.  Open your project in XCode and go to `Settings/Signing & Capabilities/Associated Domains` to add the new domain. After this, `your_project.entitlement` should look like this:

3.  Update/Create your domain’s `.well-known/apple-app-site-association` file accordingly.

For more information about supporting universal links, visit the [Supporting associated domains](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/supporting-associated-domains?language=objc) page

For a debugging guide, visit the [Debugging Universal Links](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3155-debugging-universal-links) page.  

Once everything is properly configured, and the user connects with a Link Mode-supporting wallet using One-Click Auth, your dapp will send requests through it.

  <title>Introduction - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react-native/notifications/overview</url>
  <content>AppKit Notifications provides a toolkit for integrating Web3 notification features into apps. AppKit Notifications can be used to send notifications from your app directly to wallets.

This SDK utilizes WalletConnect’s Notify API and is designed for Web3 scenarios, providing event-based notifications for activities like DAO votes, DeFi transaction alerts, and updates for NFT holders. Apps can send notifications to subscribed accounts, and users can receive and view their notifications in a supporting wallet, in the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/), or in the app’s frontend. Users can also discover Notify-compatible apps in their wallet or the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/) to subscribe to.

AppKit Notifications is not to be confused with the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/) which allows users to receive and manage their notifications from all apps, as they would in a wallet.

Getting Started
---------------

AppKit Notifications can be added to your app in a few steps:

*   [Setup your project](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react-native/notifications/cloud-setup) to send authenticated notifications.
*   Use our [frontend SDK](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react-native/notifications/frontend-integration/usage) to enable users to subscribe to notifications in your app.
*   Finally, use [Reown Cloud](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react-native/notifications/cloud-sending) or our [API in your backend](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react-native/notifications/backend-integration) to send notifications to subscribed users.

Overview
--------

Some of the key features of AppKit Notifications include:

*   **Device push notifications:** Push notifications to the user’s wallet (if it supports Notify API) or the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/).
*   **Notification history:** Notifications are stored and can be accessed from any device.
*   **Spam protection/subscription control.** Using notification types, subscribers can opt-out of certain notification types they do not want to receive.
*   **Tracking read status across devices.**

Subscribing and receiving notifications
---------------------------------------

Users can receive notifications in several places:

*   In the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/) which supports push notifications and can be installed to the user’s phone
*   In your app’s frontend using our [frontend SDK](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react-native/notifications/frontend-integration/usage)
*   Natively in their wallet if the wallet supports Notify API.
    *   You can also test with one of our sample wallets:
        *   [iOS sample wallet](https://testflight.apple.com/join/09bTAryp)
        *   [Android sample wallet](https://appdistribution.firebase.dev/i/d2c86e879abd5a86)

Users can also subscribe to notifications in all of the above locations too. To be discoverable in the Web3Inbox.com app or in wallets, apps must submit an explorer listing.

  <title>Sending with Cloud - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react-native/notifications/cloud-sending</url>
  <content>You can send notifications to subscribed users easily in [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/). Sending to users involves targeting particular [notification types](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react-native/notifications/cloud-setup#notification-types) who will receive your notification if they have not opted-out. You can specify a title and body for the notification, as well as a call-to-action link which users will be taken to when clicking on the notification.

Users can subscribe to your app in [several places](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react-native/notifications/overview#subscribing-and-receiving-notifications) including the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/), in your app with our [frontend SDK](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react-native/notifications/frontend-integration/usage), or in supporting wallets.

To send notifications, you can use the utility provided in [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/) under the Notify API section:

1.  In the APIs tab of your project, navigate to the Notify API section. You should see a banner with a link to the Send Notification playground.
    
2.  This allows you to send notifications to your subscribers. After you select the associated project, you can select the notification type, title, body, and link to send to your subscribers.</content>
</page>

<page>
  <title>Cloud Setup - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react-native/notifications/cloud-setup</url>
  <content>This page explains the configuration required in order to obtain a Notify API Secret and configure your project to send notifications.

For a quick start to experiment with, you can try the [web3inbox template](https://github.com/WalletConnect/web3inbox-client/tree/main/apps/web) and following the steps in the README.

Domain to use
-------------

It is important to understand what domain you are using for your project as you are required to host a static file (the `did.json` file) on this domain before being able to use Notify API. The [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/) and clients receiving and managing your notifications use this file to authenticate that your domain is associated with the source of the notifications.

You can pick 1 domain and this is configured in the Dapp URL field of the Notify API section of the [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/). You may change your domain at any time, as long as you properly host the new `did.json` file there. Note that only one project may use a given domain at the same time.

During development it is optional to use your production domain for testing. Instead, you can use a staging domain, or even a entirely separate domain e.g. Vercel test site. However, once you move to production you will need to update your domain to your production domain and host a new file there.

Note that the file must be hosted on a real, publicly accessible, domain in order to verify its legitimacy. The use of `localhost` or other local addresses is not allowed.

Dapp name, description, and logo
--------------------------------

The dapp name, description, and logo are displayed in wallets that integrate Notify API as well as in the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/). These details should be provided for the best user experience and to help the user identify your app.

Notification types
------------------

Notification types are an important feature of Notify API and are a way for a user to have control over what types of notifications they receive. Users can change their notification types at any time in your app, their wallet, or the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/). When sending notifications, you must use one of these configured notification types which you reference in code by its UUID.

Notification types are configured with a name, description, and icon which allow the user understand what types of notifications they would receive for that type. When a user receives a push notification on their device, they will see the icon that is configured with the notification type. Examples of notification types may include “Account updates” or “Service updates”.

Setup steps
-----------

### Navigating to Notify API section

In [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/), navigate to the APIs tab of your project.

### Configuring Notify API

Under Notify API > Configuration > `DAPP INFORMATION`, fill in the Dapp URL field. This is the domain of your app that you will use to publish notifications.

### Adding Notification Image and Types

Under the same section, next to Notification types, click on the “Add Notification Type” button and add a title, notification image and description for your notification type. This is the type of notification that your app will publish.

For example, if you are going to send promotional content as notification, you might want to add a notification type called “Promotional” with a description “Promotional content from the XYZ Team.”. You can also add a relevant image for the notification type.

### Saving Changes

Optionally, you can add a logo and description for your project. This will be shown to users when they subscribe to your app. Click “Save” to save your changes.

### Notify Secret

Take note of your new Notify API Secret. You will need this to publish notifications. This secret allows publishing notifications to any account subscribed to your app, so should not be published and should only be used by your app backend.

### Hosting did.json file

Next, you will need to host `did.json` file on this page at the `/.well-known/` directory of your public URL. Please also ensure that your application has CORS enabled. An example is linked [here.](https://github.com/WalletConnect/gm-dapp/blob/main/next.config.js)

*   Download `did.json` (click on `DID:WEB` section to show the download button ) and host it at, for example, `https://app.example.com/.well-known/did.json`
    

### Enabling Welcome Notifications

Welcome Notifications are notifications that are sent to users when they subscribe to your app. This is a great way to welcome users to your app and explain what types of notifications they will receive.

To enable Welcome Notifications, switch on the toggle in the Welcome Notifications section of your Reown Cloud project after adding relevant Notification Type, Title, Body & Link.

### Enabling Notify API

Once all changes have been saved and the `did.json` file has been deployed successfully, switch on the toggle switch in the Notify API section of your Reown Cloud project. If everything is configured correctly, you should see a success toast: “Notify configuration successfully verified”

Send Notifications in Cloud
---------------------------

Once you have completed the setup steps, you can now send notifications to users who have subscribed to your app. [Read more](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react-native/notifications/cloud-sending)

Next steps
----------

1.  Now you are ready for accounts to subscribe to your app and send notifications to them using your Notify API Secret or with Reown Cloud.

  <title>Backend Integration - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react-native/notifications/backend-integration</url>
  <content>Once an account is subscribed to your app’s notifications you can test sending notifications to the account. You can subscribe in your app directly with our [Frontend Integration](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react-native/notifications/frontend-integration/usage), or with one of the below testing options.

We recommend testing notifications with the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/) which supports push notifications and can be installed to your phone. You can also try one of our sample wallets:

*   [iOS sample wallet](https://testflight.apple.com/join/09bTAryp)
*   [Android sample wallet](https://appdistribution.firebase.dev/i/d2c86e879abd5a86)

Authentication
--------------

To send notifications and access all subscriber information for your dapp, you will need your Notify API Secret and project ID.

You can find the Notify API Secret under the Notify API section of the APIs tab of your project on [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/). Follow steps on the [Cloud Setup](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react-native/notifications/cloud-setup) page to configure this. This secret allows publishing notifications to any account subscribed to your app, so should not be published and should only be used by your app backend.

Sending notifications
---------------------

Only plaintext is supported, and newlines are ignored.

To send a notification notification you can call the `/notify` endpoint. This endpoint supports the following fields:

*   `type` - The Notification type ID copied from Reown Cloud.
*   `title` - The title of the notification. Max 64 characters.
*   `body` - The body of the notification containing more detail. Max 255 characters.
*   `url` (optional) - A URL attached to the notification that the user can navigate to. Max 255 characters.
*   `accounts` - A list of [CAIP-10](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/main/CAIPs/caip-10.md) account IDs for which to send the notification to. Max 500 accounts per request. Also see the [rate limits](https://docs.reown.com/_sites/docs.reown.com/appkit/react-native/notifications/backend-integration#rate-limits) below.
*   `notification_id` (optional) - An idempotency key of arbitrary format used to dedup multiple requests. Max 255 characters. Multiple calls with the same `notification_id` will use the first call’s `notification` content, but will send to any additional account IDs listed in `accounts`.

Example usage:

Get subscribers
---------------

You can tell if an account is subscribed and get information about subscribers using the `/v1/<project-id>/subscribers` endpoint. You can provide up to 100 accounts in the request.

If the account is subscribed, it will be returned as a key in the response along with a list of subscribed notification types as the value. If the account is not a subscriber, it will not be returned in the response.

Example usage:

Example response:

Get all subscribers
-------------------

You can get a list of all of the currently-subscribed accounts by calling the `/<project-id>/subscribers` endpoint.

Example usage:

Mark all notifications as read
------------------------------

Unless marked as read by an app frontend, notifications will always be “unread”. Because of this, when you initially add support for displaying unread status or unread count to your frontend, users that have received notifications in the past will have notifications display as “unread” even if they already have seen them. This can potentially be an undesirable user experience.

To mitigate this problem, you can make a one-time call to the `/v1/<project-id>/mark-all-as-read` API endpoint which will mark all existing notifications as read. Notifications marked as read in this way will not contribute to read rate analytics. After you deploy your integration of unread states, you can call this endpoint to reset the unread state for all of your existing notifications.

Rate limits
-----------

To protect our system and subscribers, various limits and rate limits are in-place.

Rate limits are implemented as [token bucket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket) and contain both rate and burst amounts. On average, a rate of requests can be made. However, since real-world applications often make requests in bursts, this fixed rate can be surpassed temporarily up to the burst amount, provided the app subsequently makes requests below the average in order to recover its bursting capability.

*   `POST /<project-id>/notify`:
    *   Each app can send 2 notifications per hour to an account, with a burst up to 50. Accounts that have been rate limited will be returned in the request response. Exceptions may be made on a per-project basis for special circumstances.
    *   Each app can call this endpoint 2 times per second with a burst up to 20. Rate limited requests will return a 429 status code.
*   `POST /v1/<project-id>/subscribers`
    *   Each app can call this endpoint 100 times per second with a burst up to 100. Rate limited requests will return a 429 status code.
*   `GET /<project-id>/subscribers`
    *   Each app can call this endpoint 1 time every 5 minutes with a burst up to 2. Rate limited requests will return a 429 status code.
*   `POST /v1/<project-id>/mark-all-as-read`
    *   Each app can call this endpoint 1 time per hour with a burst up to 5. Rate limited requests will return a 429 status code.</content>

  <title>Verify - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react-native/cloud/verify</url>
  <content>Verify API is a security-focused feature that allows wallets to notify end-users when they may be connecting to a suspicious or malicious domain, helping to prevent phishing attacks across the industry.

Once a wallet knows whether an end-user is on uniswap.com or eviluniswap.com, it can help them to detect potentially harmful connections through Verify’s combined offering of Reown’s domain registry.

Cloud Verification
------------------

In order to verify your app domain in Reown Cloud follow these steps:

1.  Head over to [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/)
    
2.  Create a new project or click on the project you would like to verify.
    
3.  On the settings tab, head over to the ‘Domain verification’ section and fill in the website URL that you wish to verify.
    

4.  Click on the copy button and head over to your domain Name Registrar/Provider to edit your DNS records. Alternatively, if you can’t manage DNS records for your project (eg: ENS or vercel.app) you can host a static file under `/.well-known/walletconnect.txt` which contains the entire verification code that you copied. If you are using the static file method, you can jump over step 7.
    
5.  Under `Type`, select `TXT`. In the “Answer” section, paste the text you copied from the cloud dashboard. This field may vary across DNS dashboards. If you’re trying to register a subdomain, add it under `Host`. Feel free to leave TTL at its default value.
    

6.  Depending on your DNS settings, this might take a while to reflect. You can check out DNS settings for your website with CLI tools like Dig or with websites like [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=txt)
    
7.  Once this is done and you have confirmed this change is reflected, head on back to your Cloud Dashboard and click on Verify.
    

8.  You should see a toast pop up in the bottom right section of your screen and the domain verification section should have a green tick next to it.</content>

<page>
  <title>Relay - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react-native/cloud/relay</url>
  <content>Project ID
----------

The Project ID is consumed through URL parameters.

URL parameters used:

*   `projectId`: Your Project ID can be obtained from [cloud.reown.com](https://cloud.reown.com/)

Example URL:

`https://relay.walletconnect.com/?projectId=c4f79cc821944d9680842e34466bfbd`

This can be instantiated from the client with the `projectId` in the `SignClient` constructor.

Allowlist
---------

To help prevent malicious use of your project ID you are strongly encouraged to set an allowlist of [origins](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin) or application/bundle ids for mobile applications where the project ID is used. Requests from other origins will be denied.

*   Allowlist supports a list of origins in the format `[scheme://]<hostname[:port]`.
*   [Application ID](https://developer.android.com/build/configure-app-module#set-application-id)/[Bundle IDs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/bundle_ids) typically are defined using the [reverse domain name notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation)

Using `localhost` (or `127.0.0.1`) is always permitted, and if empty all origins are allowed. Updates take 15 minutes to apply.

If scheme or port is specified, it must match exactly. Hostname must also match exactly, but wildcards can be used for individual labels within the hostname.

Example of possible origins in the allowlist:

*   `example.com` - allows `https://example.com` or `http://example.com` but not `https://www.example.com`
*   `https://example.com` - allows `https://example.com` but not `http://example.com`
*   `https://www.example.com` - allows `https://www.example.com` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://example.com:8080` - allows `https://example.com:8080` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://*.example.com` - allows `https://www.example.com` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://*.*.example.com` - allows `https://www.subdomain.example.com` but not `https://www.example.com` or `https://example.com`
*   `https://www.*.example.com` - allows `https://www.subdomain.example.com` but not `https://www.example.com`
*   `https://www-*.example.com` - invalid; `*` must be the full label

Error Codes
-----------

| Reason | Error Code |
| --- | --- |
| Project ID doesn’t exist OR JWT is expired | 401 |
| Exists and is invalid | 403 |
| Too many requests | 1013 |

Websocket Close Codes
---------------------

| Code | Description | Reconnect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1001 | Server terminating | Yes |
| 4008 | Client stale: connected without a prior subscription and is not sending data | When needed |
| 4010 | Load Rebalancing | Yes |

Best Practices
--------------

*   Create a new `projectId` for each project. This allows for more granular control, dedicated explorer listings, and project metrics.
*   Don’t reuse a `projectId`.
*   Use the AllowList to limit unauthorized usage.
*   Avoid committing projects keys to the repo. Use env variables instead.

  <title>Verify API - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/android/verify</url>
  <content>Verify API is a security-focused feature that allows wallets to notify end-users when they may be connecting to a suspicious or malicious domain, helping to prevent phishing attacks across the industry. Once a wallet knows whether an end-user is on uniswap.com or eviluniswap.com, it can help them to detect potentially harmful connections through Verify’s combined offering of Reown’s domain registry. For those looking to enable Verify on the app side, check out our reference guide [here.](https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/ios/cloud/verify)

When a user initiates a connection with an application, Verify API enables wallets to present their users with four key states that can help them determine whether the domain they’re about to connect to might be malicious.

These are:

Disclaimer
----------

Verify API is not designed to be bulletproof but to make the impersonation attack harder and require a somewhat sophisticated attacker. We are working on a new standard with various partners to close those gaps and make it bulletproof.

Domain risk detection
---------------------

The Verify security system will discriminate session proposals & session requests with distinct validations that can be either `VALID`, `INVALID` or `UNKNOWN`.

*   Domain match: The domain linked to this request has been verified as this application’s domain.
    *   This interface appears when the domain a user is attempting to connect to has been ‘verified’ in our domain registry as the registered domain of the application the user is trying to connect to, and the domain has not returned as suspicious from either of the security tools we work with. The `verifyContext` included in the request will have a validation of `VALID`.
*   Unverified: The domain sending the request cannot be verified.
    *   This interface appears when the domain a user is attempting to connect to has not been verified in our domain registry, but the domain has not returned as suspicious from either of the security tools we work with. The `verifyContext` included in the request will have a validation of `UNKNOWN`.
*   Mismatch: The application’s domain doesn’t match the sender of this request.
    *   This interface appears when the domain a user is attempting to connect to has been flagged as a different domain to the one this application has verified in our domain registry, but the domain has not returned as suspicious from either of the security tools we work with. The `verifyContext` included in the request will have a validation of `INVALID`
*   Threat: This domain is flagged as malicious and potentially harmful.
    *   This interface appears when the domain a user is attempting to connect to has been flagged as malicious on one or more of the security tools we work with. The `verifyContext` included in the request will contain parameter `isScam` with value `true`.

### Implementation

Wallet.Event.VerifyContext provides a domain verification information about SessionProposal, SessionRequest and AuthRequest.

It consists of origin of an app from where the request has been sent, validation Enum that says whether origin is `VALID`, `INVALID` or `UNKNOWN` and verify url server.</content>

  <title>Verify API - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/ios/verify</url>
  <content>Verify API is a security-focused feature that allows wallets to notify end-users when they may be connecting to a suspicious or malicious domain, helping to prevent phishing attacks across the industry. Once a wallet knows whether an end-user is on uniswap.com or eviluniswap.com, it can help them to detect potentially harmful connections through Verify’s combined offering of Reown’s domain registry. For those looking to enable Verify on the app side, check out our reference guide [here.](https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/ios/cloud/verify)

When a user initiates a connection with an application, Verify API enables wallets to present their users with four key states that can help them determine whether the domain they’re about to connect to might be malicious.

These are:

Disclaimer

Verify API is not designed to be bulletproof but to make the impersonation attack harder and require a somewhat sophisticated attacker. We are working on a new standard with various partners to close those gaps and make it bulletproof.

Domain risk detection
---------------------

The Verify security system will discriminate session proposals & session requests with distinct validations that can be either `VALID`, `INVALID` or `UNKNOWN`.

*   Domain match: The domain linked to this request has been verified as this application’s domain.
    *   This interface appears when the domain a user is attempting to connect to has been ‘verified’ in our domain registry as the registered domain of the application the user is trying to connect to, and the domain has not returned as suspicious from either of the security tools we work with. The `verifyContext` included in the request will have a validation of `VALID`.
*   Unverified: The domain sending the request cannot be verified.
    *   This interface appears when the domain a user is attempting to connect to has not been verified in our domain registry, but the domain has not returned as suspicious from either of the security tools we work with. The `verifyContext` included in the request will have a validation of `UNKNOWN`.
*   Mismatch: The application’s domain doesn’t match the sender of this request.
    *   This interface appears when the domain a user is attempting to connect to has been flagged as a different domain to the one this application has verified in our domain registry, but the domain has not returned as suspicious from either of the security tools we work with. The `verifyContext` included in the request will have a validation of `INVALID`
*   Threat: This domain is flagged as malicious and potentially harmful.
    *   This interface appears when the domain a user is attempting to connect to has been flagged as malicious on one or more of the security tools we work with. The `verifyContext` included in the request will contain parameter `isScam` with value `true`.

### Implementation

VerifyContext provides a domain verification information about Session.Proposal and Request and is relevant to the `verifyDapp` function.

It consists of origin of an app from where the request has been sent, validation enum that says whether origin is unknown, valid or invalid and verify URL server.</content>

  <title>Chain Abstraction - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/features/early-access/chain-abstraction</url>
  <content>Chain Abstraction allows users to spend stablecoins across different networks seamlessly. This solution provides wallet developers with a toolkit to integrate cross-chain functionality using WalletKit.

How it works
------------

When an application sends a `wallet_sendTransaction` request for an ERC-20 transfer (such as USDC), the wallet checks for available tokens across all supported networks. If the user has sufficient funds on any supported network, they can complete the transaction instantly, regardless of which network holds their tokens.

For example, consider a scenario where an app requests a transfer of 225 USDC on the Base Network. Even if the user doesn’t have USDC on Base, their wallet can automatically source the funds from other networks, making the experience seamless for both the user and the application.

The diagram below shows an example scenario where a user is interacting with an app and is asked to transfer 225 USDC to the app on Base Network. The user does not have any USDC on Base, but their wallet seamlessly allows them to source the funds from other networks.

Get Started

  <title>Overview - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/ios/notifications/notify/overview</url>
  <content>The WalletConnect Notify API is designed to enhance the interaction between wallet users and dapps by offering a robust notification system. This API empowers wallet developers to implement a dynamic notification experience directly within their wallets. It provides the functionality for users to opt-in to notifications, ensuring they stay informed about critical events and interactions.

The Notify API is versatile, with support for both iOS and Android platforms, making it an ideal choice for cross-platform wallet applications.

Coupled with the [AppKit Notifications](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/features/notifications), the Notify API forms part of a comprehensive toolkit that enables seamless integration of web3 communication and messaging features into dapps. This ensures a more connected and interactive experience for users in the decentralized ecosystem.

Features
--------

Some of the key features of the Notify API include:

*   **Push Notifications for Desktop and Native Platforms**: This feature enables dapps to directly send vital notifications to user wallets, ensuring timely and relevant communication.
*   **Robust Spam Protection**: Users have complete authority over which dapps can send them notifications, effectively eliminating any unsolicited messages from unknown sources. Furthermore, users can fine-tune their preferences to only receive notifications types they are interested in, like new features or some important events occurrence.
*   **Chain Agnostic Architecture**: The Notify API is built to be compatible with any blockchain, allowing seamless multi-chain support without the need for writing additional integration code. **As of November 2023, the Notify Server and Clients are equipped to support EVM chains. Plans to extend support to non-EVM chains are in progress and are a significant part of our upcoming development roadmap.**

Initialization
--------------

The WalletKit client will always be responsible for exposing accounts (CAIP10 compatible) to a Dapp and therefore is also in charge of signing. To initialize the WalletKit client, create a `Wallet.Params.Init` object in the Android Application class with the Core Client. The `Wallet.Params.Init` object will then be passed to the `WalletKit`initialize function.

The telemetry feature aims to improve the reliability and observability of connection flows between decentralized applications (dapps) and wallets. It focuses solely on collecting data about code execution and error codes, without tracking any sensitive user information like amounts, accounts etc.

It provides a comprehensive tracing system for three key use cases:

*   Subscribing to a Pairing Topic
*   Approving a Session
*   Approving an Authenticated Session

Each execution trace consists of:

*   Trace Events: Collected to verify the proper execution of code.
*   Error Events: Captured when errors occur during the trace, halting the execution trace.

When an error event is encountered, it is stored locally within the SDK along with all preceding trace events. These stored events are then transmitted to the server whenever the SDK is initialized.

Error event tracing is enabled by default.

Telemetry Enabled (telemetryEnabled = true):

*   The SDK stores events and sends them to the server.

Telemetry Disabled (telemetryEnabled = false):

*   The SDK stops storing new events and deletes all unsent events from local storage upon the next initialization.

Important Note: Since the SDK only stores abstract trace and error data, user identification is not possible.

Example of the error events:

Session
-------

A session is a connection between a dapp and a wallet. It is established when a user approves a session proposal from a dapp. A session is active until the user disconnects from the dapp or the session expires.

### Namespace Builder

With WalletKit 1.7.0 we’ve published a helper utility that greatly reduces the complexity of parsing the required and optional namespaces. It accepts as parameters a session proposal along with your wallet’s chains, methods, events, and accounts (supported namespaces) and returns ready-to-use namespaces object that has to be passed into `Wallet.Params.SessionApprove` when approving a session.

Examples of supported namespaces:

### EVM methods & events

In @walletconnect/ethereum-provider, (our abstracted EVM SDK for apps) we support by default the following Ethereum methods and events:

### Session Approval

To send an approval, pass a Proposer’s Public Key along with the map of namespaces to the `WalletKit.approveSession` function.

### Session Rejection

To send a rejection for the Session Proposal, pass a proposerPublicKey, rejection reason and rejection code to the `WalletKit.rejectSession` function.

### Responding to Session requests

To respond to JSON-RPC method that were sent from Dapps for a session, submit a `Wallet.Params.SessionRequestResponse` with the session’s topic and request ID along with the respond data to the `WalletKit.respondSessionRequest` function.

### Updating a Session

NOTE: addresses provided in `accounts` array should follow [CAIP10](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-10.md) semantics.

To update a session with namespaces, submit a `Wallet.Params.SessionUpdate` object with the session’s topic and namespaces to update session with to `WalletKit.updateSession`.

### Extending a Session

To extend a session, create a `Wallet.Params.SessionExtend` object with the session’s topic to update the session with to `WalletKit.extendSession`. Session is extended by 7 days.

### Emitting a Session

To emit an event, call emitSessionEvent() as follows:

### Session Disconnect

To disconnect from un active session, pass a disconnection reason with code and the Session topic to the `WalletKit.disconnectSession` function.

#### WalletKit.WalletDelegate

`Wallet.Event.VerifyContext` provides a domain verification information about SessionProposal, SessionRequest and AuthRequest. It consists of origin of a Dapp from where the request has been sent, validation Enum that says whether origin is VALID, INVALID or UNKNOWN and verify url server.

The WalletKit needs a `WalletKit.WalletDelegate` passed to it for it to be able to expose asynchronous updates sent from the Dapp.

#### Format message

To receive formatted SIWE message, call formatMessage method with following parameters:

#### Register Device Token

This method enables wallets to receive push notifications from WalletConnect’s Push Server via [Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging). This means you will have to setup your project with Firebase before being able to call registerDeviceToken method.

Make sure that a service extending the FirebaseMessagingService is added to your manifest as per the [Firebase FCM documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/client#manifest) as well as any other setup Firebase requires [Firebase setup documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup).

To register a wallet to receive WalletConnect push notifications, call `WalletKit.registerDeviceToken` and pass the Firebase Access Token.</content>

  <title>Mobile Linking - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/android/mobile-linking</url>
  <content>Usage
-----

Mobile Linking allows your wallet to automatically redirect back to the Dapp allowing for less user interactions and hence a better UX for your users.

### Establishing Communication Between Mobile Wallets and Apps

When integrating a wallet with a mobile application, it’s essential to understand how they communicate. The process involves two main steps:

1.  **QR Code Handshake:** The mobile app (Dapp) generates a unique URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) and displays it as a QR code. This URI acts like a secret handshake. When the user scans the QR code using their wallet app, they establish a connection. It’s like saying, “Hey, let’s chat!”
2.  **Deep Links and Universal Links:** The URI from the QR code allows the wallet app to create a [deep link](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/10023042?hl=en#:~:text=Deep%20links%20send%20mobile%20device,%2C%20Shopping%2C%20and%20Display%20campaigns.) or [universal link](https://developer.apple.com/ios/universal-links/). These links work on both Android and iOS. They enable seamless communication between the wallet and the app.

### Key Behavior to Address

In some scenarios, wallets use redirect metadata provided in session proposals to open applications. This can cause unintended behavior, such as:

Redirecting to the wrong app when multiple apps share the same redirect metadata (e.g., a desktop and mobile version of the same Dapp). Opening an unrelated application if a QR code is scanned on a different device than where the wallet is installed.

#### Recommended Approach

To avoid this behavior, wallets should:

*   **Restrict Redirect Metadata to Deep Link Use Cases**: Redirect metadata should only be used when the session proposal is initiated through a deep link. QR code scans should not trigger app redirects using session proposal metadata.

The connection and sign request flows are similar across platforms.

### Connection Flow

*   **Dapp Prompts User:** The Dapp asks the user to connect.
*   **User Chooses Wallet:** The user selects a wallet from a list of compatible wallets.
*   **Redirect to Wallet:** The user is redirected to their chosen wallet.
*   **Wallet Approval:** The wallet prompts the user to approve or reject the session (similar to granting permission).
*   **Return to Dapp:**
    *   **Manual Return:** The wallet asks the user to manually return to the Dapp.
    *   **Automatic Return:** Alternatively, the wallet automatically takes the user back to the Dapp.
*   **User Reunites with Dapp:** After all the interactions, the user ends up back in the Dapp.

### Sign Request Flow

When the Dapp needs the user to sign something (like a transaction), a similar pattern occurs:

*   **Automatic Redirect:** The Dapp automatically sends the user to their previously chosen wallet.
*   **Approval Prompt:** The wallet asks the user to approve or reject the request.
*   **Return to Dapp:**
    *   **Manual Return:** The wallet asks the user to manually return to the Dapp.
    *   **Automatic Return:** Alternatively, the wallet automatically takes the user back to the Dapp.
*   **User Reconnects:** Eventually, the user returns to the Dapp.

In order for Dapps to be able to trigger your wallet for a connection or sign request using deep links you first need to add your own wallet to the Explorer by login to your [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/sign-in) account, declare a deep link and define an [`<intent-filter>`](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/deep-linking#adding-filters) in your wallet’s Manifest.xml with the same deep link added in Explorer:

### How to test

Before submitting your project to the Cloud Explorer you can test mobile linking in our sample Dapp:

1.  On your mobile device, visit the appropriate link:

*   For EVM: [https://appkit-lab.reown.com/library/wagmi/](https://appkit-lab.reown.com/library/wagmi/)
*   For Solana: [https://appkit-lab.reown.com/library/solana/](https://appkit-lab.reown.com/library/solana/)

2.  Click the “Custom Wallet” button and fill in the form with your wallet information. The website will reload and your wallet will be stored locally.
3.  Click the “Connect Wallet” button and choose your mobile wallet. It _should_ automatically open and redirect to your wallet.

#### Wallet Support

**Disclaimer:** The below solution is designed for the communication between native Android Dapps and native Android wallets. In the case of mobile browser Dapps and native Android wallets communication, we recommend moving wallets into the background after both approving and rejecting sessions or approving and rejecting requests to persist smooth deep-link UX.

In order to add support for mobile linking within your wallet and receive session proposals, register following deep link in your mobile wallet using intent filters in your Activity/Fragment or deepLink tag in your navigation graph.

To support universal native modal and WalletConnectModal register: `wc://`

Deep link example: `examplewallet://wc?uri={pairingUri}`

To receive signing request in your Wallet, you’ll need to initialize Kotlin SDK with the `Redirect` object where you pass a deep link that redirects to your wallet when it comes to receiving signing request from Dapp.

Redirect when responding to a session proposal:

Redirect when responding to a request:

**Heads-up:** To make this flow working well, Wallet must register one of its Android components with the same deep link that it initialized with.

To check the flow implementation described above have a look on our sample wallet: [https://github.com/WalletConnect/WalletConnectKotlinV2/tree/master/sample/wallet](https://github.com/WalletConnect/WalletConnectKotlinV2/tree/master/sample/wallet)

#### Dapp Support

To send session proposals to mobile wallet user the pairing URI as deep link that triggers a wallet to open and consume pairing URI

In order to add support for mobile linking within your Dapp and receive signing request responses from wallet, you’ll need to initialize Kotlin SDK with the `Redirect` object where you pass a deep link that redirects to your Dapp when it comes to receiving signing request responses from wallet.

**Heads-up:** To make this flow working well, Dapp must register one of its Android components with the same deep link that it initialized with.

To check the flow implementation described above have a look on our Sample Dapp: [https://github.com/WalletConnect/WalletConnectKotlinV2/tree/master/sample/dapp](https://github.com/WalletConnect/WalletConnectKotlinV2/tree/master/sample/dapp)

  <title>Link Mode - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/android/link-mode</url>
  <content>WalletKit Link Mode is a low latency mechanism for transporting [One-Click Auth](https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/android/one-click-auth) requests and session requests over Universal Links, reducing the need for a WebSocket connection with the Relay. This significantly enhances the user experience when connecting native dApps to native wallets by reducing the latency associated with network connections, especially when the user has an unstable internet connection.

To support Link Mode add a universal link for your wallet in Cloud project configuration dashboard, configure your AppMetaData `appLink` with a valid universal link and set the `linkMode` property to `true`:

Once link mode and app link are properly configured and the user interacts with a link mode supporting dApp, your wallet will receive requests over app links. You must pass these requests to WalletKit so it can process them:

Ensure to handle incoming app links in your Activity onCreate method and in onNewIntent callback.

Ensure that your App Link is properly configured in your app’s Manifest file with the `autoVerify` set to `true`:

For more information on how to configure app links for your app, refer to the [Android Documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/verify-android-applinks).

For enabling links to app content check [this](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/deep-linking) documentation page.

  <title>Wallet Call API - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/android/eip5792</url>
  <content>WalletConnect supports [EIP-5792](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5792#atomicbatch-capability), which defines new JSON-RPC methods that enable apps to ask a wallet to process a batch of onchain write calls and to check on the status of those calls. Applications can specify that these onchain calls be executed taking advantage of specific capabilities previously expressed by the wallet; an additional, a novel wallet RPC is defined to enable apps to query the wallet for those capabilities.

*   `wallet_sendCalls`: Requests that a wallet submits a batch of calls.
*   `wallet_getCallsStatus`: Returns the status of a call batch that was sent via wallet\_sendCalls.
*   `wallet_showCallsStatus`: Requests that a wallet shows information about a given call bundle that was sent with wallet\_sendCalls.
*   `wallet_getCapabilities`: This RPC allows an application to request capabilities from a wallet (e.g. batch transactions, paymaster communication).</content>

  <title>Best Practices - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/android/best-practices</url>
  <content>The purpose of this guide is to show the best practices in regards of the WalletKit client usage. The goal is to provide the best user experience that just works in every circumstances.

Pairing
-------

A pairing is a connection between a wallet and a dapp that has fixed permissions to only allow a dapp to propose a session through it. Dapp can propose infinite number of sessions on one pairing. Wallet must use a pair method from WalletKit client to pair with dapp.

### Pairing State

A pairing state is a primitive exposed by the WalletKit client for a wallet to indicate whether it should await a session proposal. The pairing state is `true` when a wallet scans a QR and awaits a session proposal. Once the session proposal is received by the wallet, the pairing state is changed to `false`. When `true` wallet should show a loading indicator awaiting a session proposal, when changed to `false` a proposal dialog should be displayed.

### Pairing Expiry

A pairing expiry event is triggered whenever a pairing is expired. The expiry for inactive pairing is 5 mins, whereas for active pairing is 30 days. A pairing becomes active when a session proposal is received and user successfully approves it. This event helps to know when given pairing expires and update UI accordingly.

### Expected User flow

### Pairing Flow

### Pairing Error

### Expected Errors

While pairing the following errors might occur:

*   No Internet connection error or pairing timeout when scanning QR with no Internet connection
    *   User should pair again with Internet connection
*   Pairing expired error when scanning a QR code with expired pairing
    *   User should refresh a QR code and scan again
*   Pairing with existing pairing is not allowed
    *   User should refresh a QR code and scan again. I usually happens when user scans an already paired QR code.

Session Proposal
----------------

A session proposal is a handshake sent by a dapp and it’s purpose is to define a session rules. Whenever a user wants to establish a connection between a wallet and a dapp, one should approve a session proposal.

### User Action Feedback

Whenever user approves or rejects a session proposal, wallet should show loading indicators in a moment of the button press until Relay acknowledgement is received for any of this actions.

Session approve

Session reject

### Session Proposal Expiry

A session proposal expiry is 5 mins. It means a given proposal is stored for 5 mins in the SDK storage and user has 5 mins for approval or rejection decision. After that time the below event is emitted and proposal modal should be removed from the app’s UI.

### Expected User flow

### Approve or Reject Session Proposal

### Error Handling

### Expected Errors

While approving or rejecting a session proposal the following errors might occurs:

*   No Internet connection
    *   It happens when a user tries to approve or reject session proposal with no Internet connection
*   Session proposal expired
    *   It happens when users tries to approve or reject expired session proposal
*   Invalid namespaces
    *   It happens when a validation of session namespaces fails
*   Timeout
    *   It happens when Relay doesn’t acknowledge session settle publish within 10s

Session Request
---------------

A session request represents the request sent by a dapp to a wallet.

### User Action Feedback

Whenever user approves or rejects a session request, wallet should show loading indicators in a moment of the button press until Relay acknowledgement is received for any of this actions.

### Session Request Expiry

A session request expiry is defined by a dapp. It’s value must be between now() + 5mins and now() + 7 days. After the session request expires the below event is emitted and session request modal should be removed from the app’s UI.

### Expected User flow

### Approve or Reject Session Proposal

### Error Handling

### Expected Errors

While approving or rejecting a session request the following error might occur:

*   Invalid session
    *   This error might happen when user approves or rejects a session request on expired session
*   Session request expired
    *   This error might happen when user approves or rejects a session request that already expires
*   Timeout
    *   It happens when Relay doesn’t acknowledge session settle publish within 10s

Web Socket Connection State
---------------------------

The Web Socket connection state tracks the connection with the relay server, event is emitted whenever a connection state changes.

  <title>Push Notifications - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/android/notifications/push</url>
  <content>WalletKit provides the functionality for wallets to receive push notifications through Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) and Apple Push Notification Service (APNs) via the Push Server. This feature ensures that wallets are promptly notified of incoming signature requests. Each push notification contains the encrypted details of the signature request. Upon receiving the notification, it can be decrypted and presented to the developer, allowing for customization of the message according to their requirements.

Server setup
------------

For the push notifications to be forwarded to FCM or APNs, the [Push Server](https://docs.reown.com/advanced/push-server) will need to be configured with your FCM or APNs server API credentials.

App setup
---------

### Register the device token

To enable a device for push notifications, it’s essential to register the device token using `WalletKit.registerDeviceToken`. This token can be obtained from either FCM or APNS, depending on the platform used.

This method enables wallets to receive push notifications from WalletConnect’s Push Server via Firebase Cloud Messaging. This means you will have to setup your project with Firebase before being able to call `registerDeviceToken()` method.

To register a wallet to receive WalletConnect push notifications, call `WalletKit.registerDeviceToken` and pass the Firebase Access Token.

### Receiving push notifications

After the device token is registered, the next step involves setting up the notification service specific to the platform being used. This service will decrypt the incoming requests and forward them to the developer for further processing and integration.

The `PushMessagingService` is a wrapper around the `FirebaseMessagingService`. The `PushMessagingService` class needs to be implemented for WalletKit to be able to decrypt and notify wallets of a push notification sent from the Dapp in the background. This service also needs to be registered in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file similar to the example in the FCM documentation.</content>

  <title>Overview - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/android/notifications/notify/overview</url>
  <content>The WalletConnect Notify API is designed to enhance the interaction between wallet users and dapps by offering a robust notification system. This API empowers wallet developers to implement a dynamic notification experience directly within their wallets. It provides the functionality for users to opt-in to notifications, ensuring they stay informed about critical events and interactions.

The Notify API is versatile, with support for both iOS and Android platforms, making it an ideal choice for cross-platform wallet applications.

Coupled with the [AppKit Notifications](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/features/notifications), the Notify API forms part of a comprehensive toolkit that enables seamless integration of web3 communication and messaging features into dapps. This ensures a more connected and interactive experience for users in the decentralized ecosystem.

Features
--------

Some of the key features of the Notify API include:

*   **Push Notifications for Desktop and Native Platforms**: This feature enables dapps to directly send vital notifications to user wallets, ensuring timely and relevant communication.
*   **Robust Spam Protection**: Users have complete authority over which dapps can send them notifications, effectively eliminating any unsolicited messages from unknown sources. Furthermore, users can fine-tune their preferences to only receive notifications types they are interested in, like new features or some important events occurrence.
*   **Chain Agnostic Architecture**: The Notify API is built to be compatible with any blockchain, allowing seamless multi-chain support without the need for writing additional integration code. **As of November 2023, the Notify Server and Clients are equipped to support EVM chains. Plans to extend support to non-EVM chains are in progress and are a significant part of our upcoming development roadmap.**

  <title>Chain Abstraction - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/android/early-access/chain-abstraction</url>
  <content>Chain Abstraction in WalletKit enables users with stablecoins on any network to spend them on-the-fly on a different network. Our Chain Abstraction solution provides a toolkit for wallet developers to integrate this complex functionality using WalletKit.

For example, when an app requests a 100 USDC payment on Base network but the user only has USDC on Arbitrum, WalletKit offers methods to detect this mismatch, generate necessary transactions, track the cross-chain transfer, and complete the original transaction after bridging finishes.

How It Works
------------

When sending a transaction, you need to:

1.  Check if the required chain has enough funds to complete the transaction
2.  If not, use the `prepare` method to generate necessary bridging transactions
3.  Sign routing and initial transaction hashes, prepared by the prepare method
4.  Use `execute` method to broadcast routing and initial transactions and wait for it to be completed

The following sequence diagram illustrates the complete flow of a chain abstraction operation, from the initial dapp request to the final transaction confirmation

Methods
-------

The following methods from WalletKit are used in implementing chain abstraction.

### Prepare

This method is used to check if chain abstraction is needed. If it is, it will return a `PrepareSuccess.Available` object with the necessary transactions and funding information. If it is not, it will return a `PrepareSuccess.NotRequired` object with the original transaction.

### Execute

This method is used to execute the chain abstraction operation. It broadcasts the bridging and initial transactions and waits for them to be completed. The method returns a `ExecuteSuccess` object with the transaction hash and receipt.

### Usage

When sending a transaction, first check if chain abstraction is needed using the `prepare` method. If it is needed, you must sign all the fulfillment transactions and use the `execute` method.

If the operation is successful, use `execute` method and await the transaction hash and receipt. If the operation is unsuccessful, send the JsonRpcError to the dapp and display the error to the user.

For example, check out implementation of chain abstraction in [sample wallet](https://github.com/WalletConnect/WalletConnectKotlinV2/tree/master/sample/wallet) with Kotlin.

Testing
-------

To test Chain Abstraction, you can use the [AppKit laboratory](https://appkit-lab.reown.com/library/wagmi/) and try sending [USDC/USDT](https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/features/early-access/chain-abstraction.mdx#what-are-the-supported-tokens-and-networks) with any chain abstraction supported wallet. You can also use this [sample wallet](https://appdistribution.firebase.dev/i/076a3bc9669d3bee) for testing.

ProGuard rules
--------------

If you encounter issues with minification, add the below rules to your application:</content>
</page>

<page>
  <title>Verify - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/android/cloud/verify</url>
  <content>Verify API is a security-focused feature that allows wallets to notify end-users when they may be connecting to a suspicious or malicious domain, helping to prevent phishing attacks across the industry.

Once a wallet knows whether an end-user is on uniswap.com or eviluniswap.com, it can help them to detect potentially harmful connections through Verify’s combined offering of Reown’s domain registry.

Cloud Verification
------------------

In order to verify your app domain in Reown Cloud follow these steps:

1.  Head over to [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/)
    
2.  Create a new project or click on the project you would like to verify.
    
3.  On the settings tab, head over to the ‘Domain verification’ section and fill in the website URL that you wish to verify.
    

4.  Click on the copy button and head over to your domain Name Registrar/Provider to edit your DNS records. Alternatively, if you can’t manage DNS records for your project (eg: ENS or vercel.app) you can host a static file under `/.well-known/walletconnect.txt` which contains the entire verification code that you copied. If you are using the static file method, you can jump over step 7.
    
5.  Under `Type`, select `TXT`. In the “Answer” section, paste the text you copied from the cloud dashboard. This field may vary across DNS dashboards. If you’re trying to register a subdomain, add it under `Host`. Feel free to leave TTL at its default value.
    

6.  Depending on your DNS settings, this might take a while to reflect. You can check out DNS settings for your website with CLI tools like Dig or with websites like [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=txt)
    
7.  Once this is done and you have confirmed this change is reflected, head on back to your Cloud Dashboard and click on Verify.
    

8.  You should see a toast pop up in the bottom right section of your screen and the domain verification section should have a green tick next to it.</content>

  <title>Relay - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/android/cloud/relay</url>
  <content>Project ID
----------

The Project ID is consumed through URL parameters.

URL parameters used:

*   `projectId`: Your Project ID can be obtained from [cloud.reown.com](https://cloud.reown.com/)

Example URL:

`https://relay.walletconnect.com/?projectId=c4f79cc821944d9680842e34466bfbd`

This can be instantiated from the client with the `projectId` in the `SignClient` constructor.

Allowlist
---------

To help prevent malicious use of your project ID you are strongly encouraged to set an allowlist of [origins](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin) or application/bundle ids for mobile applications where the project ID is used. Requests from other origins will be denied.

*   Allowlist supports a list of origins in the format `[scheme://]<hostname[:port]`.
*   [Application ID](https://developer.android.com/build/configure-app-module#set-application-id)/[Bundle IDs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/bundle_ids) typically are defined using the [reverse domain name notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation)

Using `localhost` (or `127.0.0.1`) is always permitted, and if empty all origins are allowed. Updates take 15 minutes to apply.

If scheme or port is specified, it must match exactly. Hostname must also match exactly, but wildcards can be used for individual labels within the hostname.

Example of possible origins in the allowlist:

*   `example.com` - allows `https://example.com` or `http://example.com` but not `https://www.example.com`
*   `https://example.com` - allows `https://example.com` but not `http://example.com`
*   `https://www.example.com` - allows `https://www.example.com` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://example.com:8080` - allows `https://example.com:8080` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://*.example.com` - allows `https://www.example.com` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://*.*.example.com` - allows `https://www.subdomain.example.com` but not `https://www.example.com` or `https://example.com`
*   `https://www.*.example.com` - allows `https://www.subdomain.example.com` but not `https://www.example.com`
*   `https://www-*.example.com` - invalid; `*` must be the full label

Error Codes
-----------

| Reason | Error Code |
| --- | --- |
| Project ID doesn’t exist OR JWT is expired | 401 |
| Exists and is invalid | 403 |
| Too many requests | 1013 |

Websocket Close Codes
---------------------

| Code | Description | Reconnect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1001 | Server terminating | Yes |
| 4008 | Client stale: connected without a prior subscription and is not sending data | When needed |
| 4010 | Load Rebalancing | Yes |

Best Practices
--------------

*   Create a new `projectId` for each project. This allows for more granular control, dedicated explorer listings, and project metrics.
*   Don’t reuse a `projectId`.
*   Use the AllowList to limit unauthorized usage.
*   Avoid committing projects keys to the repo. Use env variables instead.

  <title>Mobile Linking - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/flutter/mobile-linking#platform-preparations</url>
  <content>Usage
-----

Mobile Linking allows your wallet to automatically redirect back to the Dapp allowing for less user interactions and hence a better UX for your users.

### Establishing Communication Between Mobile Wallets and Apps

When integrating a wallet with a mobile application, it’s essential to understand how they communicate. The process involves two main steps:

1.  **QR Code Handshake:** The mobile app (Dapp) generates a unique URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) and displays it as a QR code. This URI acts like a secret handshake. When the user scans the QR code using their wallet app, they establish a connection. It’s like saying, “Hey, let’s chat!”
2.  **Deep Links and Universal Links:** The URI from the QR code allows the wallet app to create a [deep link](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/10023042?hl=en#:~:text=Deep%20links%20send%20mobile%20device,%2C%20Shopping%2C%20and%20Display%20campaigns.) or [universal link](https://developer.apple.com/ios/universal-links/). These links work on both Android and iOS. They enable seamless communication between the wallet and the app.

### Key Behavior to Address

In some scenarios, wallets use redirect metadata provided in session proposals to open applications. This can cause unintended behavior, such as:

Redirecting to the wrong app when multiple apps share the same redirect metadata (e.g., a desktop and mobile version of the same Dapp). Opening an unrelated application if a QR code is scanned on a different device than where the wallet is installed.

#### Recommended Approach

To avoid this behavior, wallets should:

*   **Restrict Redirect Metadata to Deep Link Use Cases**: Redirect metadata should only be used when the session proposal is initiated through a deep link. QR code scans should not trigger app redirects using session proposal metadata.

The connection and sign request flows are similar across platforms.

### Connection Flow

*   **Dapp Prompts User:** The Dapp asks the user to connect.
*   **User Chooses Wallet:** The user selects a wallet from a list of compatible wallets.
*   **Redirect to Wallet:** The user is redirected to their chosen wallet.
*   **Wallet Approval:** The wallet prompts the user to approve or reject the session (similar to granting permission).
*   **Return to Dapp:**
    *   **Manual Return:** The wallet asks the user to manually return to the Dapp.
    *   **Automatic Return:** Alternatively, the wallet automatically takes the user back to the Dapp.
*   **User Reunites with Dapp:** After all the interactions, the user ends up back in the Dapp.

### Sign Request Flow

When the Dapp needs the user to sign something (like a transaction), a similar pattern occurs:

*   **Automatic Redirect:** The Dapp automatically sends the user to their previously chosen wallet.
*   **Approval Prompt:** The wallet asks the user to approve or reject the request.
*   **Return to Dapp:**
    *   **Manual Return:** The wallet asks the user to manually return to the Dapp.
    *   **Automatic Return:** Alternatively, the wallet automatically takes the user back to the Dapp.
*   **User Reconnects:** Eventually, the user returns to the Dapp.

Platform preparations
---------------------

In order for Dapps to be able to trigger your wallet for a connection or sign request using deep links you first need to add your custom scheme under [`CFBundleURLTypes`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/cfbundleurltypes) key in your Info.plist file.

For instance, if your Wallet’s name is Example Wallet, your custom scheme would be more likely as `examplewallet://`, therefor you will add the following in your iOS’s Info.plist file:

### How to test

Before submitting your project to the Cloud Explorer you can test mobile linking in our sample Dapp:

1.  On your mobile device, visit the appropriate link:

*   For EVM: [https://appkit-lab.reown.com/library/wagmi/](https://appkit-lab.reown.com/library/wagmi/)
*   For Solana: [https://appkit-lab.reown.com/library/solana/](https://appkit-lab.reown.com/library/solana/)

2.  Click the “Custom Wallet” button and fill in the form with your wallet information. The website will reload and your wallet will be stored locally.
3.  Click the “Connect Wallet” button and choose your mobile wallet. It _should_ automatically open and redirect to your wallet.

Learn more about mobile linking in the [Best Practices section](https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/best-practices#2-mobile-linking).

Integration
-----------

Either you are approving a session proposal or responding to a session request, redirecting back to the Dapp is as simply as launching requester’s `redirect` object in `PairingMetadata`, the same way as Dapps would call your wallet’s `redirect` object on their side:

A dapp would call `examplewallet://wc?uri={pairingUri}` from their side when they request to connect with your wallet, and given the fact that `examplewallet` is your registered custom scheme then your wallet will be opened.

### Redirecting back to dapp (proposer) after session approval:

WalletKit SDK exports a handy method for easy redirection back to the requester app, whether it be after a session proposal, a session authentication or a session request.

After Session Proposal:

After Session Authenticate:

A dapp would call `examplewallet://` (or even better `session.peer?.metadata.redirect?.native` object) from their side when they request to sign a transaction, and given the fact that `session.peer?.metadata.redirect?.native` contains your registered custom scheme (`examplewallet://`) then your wallet will be opened.

QR code scans should not trigger app redirects using session proposal metadata. Ensure Unique Redirect URIs for Cross-Platform Apps: Cross-platform Dapps should use distinct redirect URIs for their mobile and desktop versions to avoid conflicts.

Integration
-----------

### iOS Wallet Support

iOS has some more caveats to the integration but we ensure to make it as straightforward as possible. Since its operating system is not designed to handle multiple applications subscribing to the same deep linking schema, we’ve designed the AppKit to list supporting wallets on our [WalletGuide](https://walletguide.walletconnect.network/) and target specific deep links or universal links for each wallet.

To add your own wallet to the Explorer, login to your [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/sign-in) account.

Additionally when there is a signing request triggered by the Dapp it will hit the deep link with an incomplete URI, this should be ignored and not considered valid as it’s only used for automatically redirecting the users to approve or reject a signing request.

### WalletConnectRouter

### Overview

WalletConnectRouter simplifies navigation by automatically redirecting users back to the DApp after they’ve interacted with a wallet via a deep link. This eliminates the need for users to manually navigate back after approving a session or confirming a transaction.

### Key Features

**Automatic Redirection:** By invoking WalletConnectRouter.goBack(uri: “example://”)—where “example://” is the DApp’s custom scheme as declared in their AppMetadata redirect field—users are seamlessly returned to the DApp.

### Important Consideration

**Mandatory redirect Field:** Starting with WalletConnect SDK version 1.9.5, specifying the redirect field in the AppMetadata object is mandatory to avoid redirection issues.

### Installation and Usage

* * *

### Limitations

This section outlines some of the known limitations and constraints when using WalletConnect on iOS.

### Redirects on iOS 17 and Above

Automatic redirection to browser-based DApps after wallet interaction is not possible from iOS 17 onwards. Developers should adjust their app’s UI to inform users about manual navigation back to the browser.

For iOS versions below 17, `WalletConnectRouter.goBack(uri: uri)` facilitates automatic redirection.

### iOS Universal Links Constraints

When using WalletConnect on iOS and triggering a wallet interaction (e.g. when sending a transaction or signing a message), you may experience issues where the native app is not opened as expected and a browser navigation occurs instead.

This issue occurs because Universal Links (app links) on iOS will only open the native app when the following rules are followed:

*   **The wallet interaction must be triggered by a user-initiated event,** e.g. in a click handler rather than on page load or in an asynchronous callback.
*   **The wallet interaction must be triggered as soon as possible within the event handler.** Any preceding asynchronous work (e.g. estimating gas, resolving an ENS name, fetching a nonce) should have already completed before the event handler fires. This may require you to design the user experience around this constraint, preventing users from initiating a wallet interaction until it’s ready rather than doing the work lazily.

**Note that even if your own code follows these rules, libraries you depend on may be running their own asynchronous logic before triggering a wallet interaction.** For example, [Ethers asynchronously populates transactions before sending them.](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/signer/#Signer-sendTransaction) Known workarounds are documented below, but if you’re still experiencing these issues, you should raise them with the relevant library maintainers.

### For Ethers v5 (Legacy)

These are the known workarounds for avoiding app linking issues on iOS when using [Ethers v5](https://docs.ethers.io/v5).

### When sending a transaction

1.  **[`signer.sendTransaction`](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/signer/#Signer-sendTransaction) should be avoided in favor of [`signer.sendUncheckedTransaction`](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/providers/jsonrpc-provider/#JsonRpcSigner-sendUncheckedTransaction)**  
     This avoids an asynchronous call to retrieve the internal block number which Ethers uses to resolve a complete [`TransactionResponse`](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/providers/types/#providers-TransactionResponse) object.  
     Note that as a result of this optimization, `sendUncheckedTransaction` returns a mock transaction response that only contains the `hash` property and a `wait` method. All other properties are `null`.
2.  **The transaction’s `to` property should be a plain address rather than an ENS name**  
    This avoids an asynchronous call to automatically resolve ENS names during the send process.  
     If you still want to support ENS name resolution, you should manually run [`provider.resolveName`](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/providers/provider/#Provider-ResolveName) ahead of time, storing the result before the user attempts to send a transaction. Do not resolve ENS names in the event handler.
3.  **The transaction’s `gasLimit` property should be set**  
    This avoids the asynchronous work performed in `sendTransaction` which automatically estimates the gas limit if it’s missing.  
     If you still want to use the same gas limit estimation logic from `sendTransaction`, you should manually run [`provider.estimateGas`](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/providers/provider/#Provider-estimateGas) ahead of time, storing the result before the user attempts to send the transaction. Do not estimate gas in the event handler.

### When calling a write method on a contract

1.  **[`contract.METHOD_NAME`](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/contract/contract/#contract-functionsSend) should be avoided if favor of calling [`contract.populateTransaction.METHOD_NAME`](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/contract/contract/#contract-populateTransaction) ahead of time, then sending the populated transaction with [`signer.sendUncheckedTransaction`](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/providers/jsonrpc-provider/#JsonRpcSigner-sendUncheckedTransaction).**
    
2.  When sending the populated transaction, you should [follow the same guidelines as regular transactions](https://docs.reown.com/_sites/docs.reown.com/walletkit/ios/mobile-linking#when-sending-a-transaction) to avoid any asynchronous logic breaking the app link navigation. Do not populate the contract transaction in the event handler.
    

### When signing a message

If the message depends on the result of an asynchronous call (e.g. retrieving a nonce when implementing [Sign-In With Ethereum](https://login.xyz/)), you should do this work ahead of time, storing the result before the user attempts to sign the message. Do not perform this asynchronous work in the event handler.</content>

  <title>Glossary - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/advanced/glossary#namespaces</url>
  <content>Sequence
--------

Sequences refers to a complete flow starting from a Proposal and reaching Settlement. A proposer will create a sequence proposal that will derive a Signal to share out-of-band with the responder in order to reach agreement regarding different permissions and conditions for the sequence. A Sequence establishes how the two clients will relay messages with each other, which keys they will use to encrypt and authenticate messages and additionally what are the permissions regarding the JSON-RPC requests that can be made, notifications that can be emitted and what state will be shared.

There are two types of sequences specified by the protocol called Pairing and Session.

Pairing
-------

Pairing is a specialized sequence which has fixed permissions to only allow a client to propose sessions through it using the method `wc_sessionPropose` which it will be used as a signal out-of-band for session proposals.

Session
-------

Session is a generalized sequence which has customizable permissions regarding JSON-RPC requests, notifications emitted and also what accounts are exposed based on the set of chains determined in the permissions.

Signal
------

A signal is a payload that can be shared outside of the sequence (out-of-band) to communicate a proposal to another client. Each sequence has its own type of signal.

Pairing is a specialized sequence which has fixed permissions therefore the signal can be encoded as an URI using only the proposal topic, proposer’s publicKey, relay protocol options and the controller flag for the proposer. This can be shared either through a qrcode or deep link between clients.

Session is a generalized sequence which has customized permissions therefore the signal is a proposal sent through a settled pairing already established between the two clients.

Settlement
----------

Settlement refers to the internal event which both clients will execute from a successful response of a sequence proposal.

In the case of a responder, the settlement happens before the response is published to the proposer.

In the case of a proposer, the settlement happens after receiving the response published by the responder.

Settlement will generate a shared key using the key pairs of the participants and it will determine the topic from hashing the shared key which is only known to both participants

Controller
----------

A client can be either a controller or non-controller. This means that all sequences responded and/or proposed by this client will be controlled by it.

A controller is not bounded by the permissions set by the sequence, meaning it can send any JSON-RPC request, emit any notification type and is the only participant that upgrade the permissions or update the state of the sequence.

The controller client will always be the “wallet” which is exposing blockchain accounts to a “dapp” and therefore is also in charge of signing.

Disconnecting is however not exclusive to the controller client and can be triggered by either participants.

Expiry
------

Expiry refers to the timestamp when the sequence is deleted.

Whenever the responder settles the sequence it calculates the expiry by adding the TTL to the current timestamp. The proposer would then use the expiry calculated by the responder.

Expiry times are always represented in seconds.

Time to Live (TTL)
------------------

Time to live (TTL) refers to the maximum duration for a sequence to live.

TTL plus the current timestamp is used to calculate the expiry timestamp.

TTL times are always represented in seconds.

Shared key is the key derived using both participants key pairs using the elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement scheme.

The chosen elliptic curve was Curve25519 offering 128 bits of security (256 bits key size) which was specifically designed for ECDH and it’s widely supported by many different platforms natively. The name of its DH function is X25519

Authenticated Encryption
------------------------

Authenticated Encryption refers to a form of encryption which simultaneously assures the confidentiality and authenticity of data.

The chosen approach was to encrypt-then-mac which produces a MAC based on the resulting ciphertext. The encryption uses AES-256-CBC with a random Initialization Vector (IV) and authentication uses HMAC-SHA256. The encrypted payloads are serialized in the following order: iv, publicKey, mac and cipherText.

To derive the encryption and authentication keys it uses a SHA512 hash of the shared key using the first 32bytes for encryption and the last 32 bytes for authentication

JSON-RPC
--------

JSON-RPC is a stateless, light weight remote procedure call (RPC) protocol which uses JSON (RFC 4627) as data format. You can read more about JSON-RPC specification [here](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification)

Relay
-----

Relay refers to the system, network and/or mechanism used to send and receives messages between the two clients.

Publish-Subscribe pattern
-------------------------

Publish-Subscribe (also known as PubSub) is a messaging pattern where senders of messages (publishers) do not send messages directly to receivers but instead label messages with a topic that can be listened to by subscribers. Subscribers only receive messages matching the topics that have expressed interest on.

Topics
------

Topics are 32 bytes hexadecimal strings which are used to identify messages sent between two clients regarding either proposed sequences or settled sequences. Proposed sequences use a randomly generated topic while Settled sequences use a SHA256 hash of the sharedKey.

Namespaces
----------

Namespaces are used to specify the chains, methods and events that are intended to be used in a particular session. They establish the minimal requirement for a wallet and a dapp to get paired. There are two types of namespaces,

### Proposal namespaces

A dapp sends a proposal namespace to the wallet for pairing. The proposal namespace contains the list of chains, methods and events that are required for the dapp. The wallet validates if the received proposal namespaces are valid and returns a session namespace as a response if it is valid. If the requested proposal namespaces are not valid, the session cannot be established and the wallet rejects it with an error code that tells the dapp if the proposal namespaces have invalid chains, methods, events or if it was rejected by the user

**Example :** If a dapp wants access to Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon and Cosmos Mainnet - the required chains, methods and events should be mentioned in the proposal namespaces request as follows :

### Session namespaces

The dapp validates if the received proposal namespaces comply with the session namespaces. If they comply, a session is established successfully and pairing is completed. If not, the session is not established and all the cached data related to the namespaces are deleted. The session namespace can also choose to provide access to more chains, methods or events that were not a part of the proposal namespaces.

**Example :** The following is an example for a session namespace which complies with the requested proposal namespace example,

You can also see that `personal_sign` method and `proofFinalized` event are not requested by the proposal namespaces but is still granted by the session namespaces. Hence, session namespaces can grant additional access to more chains, methods and events which were not requested by the proposal namespaces.</content>

  <title>Mobile Linking - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/react-native/mobile-linking#platform-preparations</url>
  <content>Usage
-----

Mobile Linking allows your wallet to automatically redirect back to the Dapp allowing for less user interactions and hence a better UX for your users.

### Establishing Communication Between Mobile Wallets and Apps

When integrating a wallet with a mobile application, it’s essential to understand how they communicate. The process involves two main steps:

1.  **QR Code Handshake:** The mobile app (Dapp) generates a unique URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) and displays it as a QR code. This URI acts like a secret handshake. When the user scans the QR code using their wallet app, they establish a connection. It’s like saying, “Hey, let’s chat!”
2.  **Deep Links and Universal Links:** The URI from the QR code allows the wallet app to create a [deep link](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/10023042?hl=en#:~:text=Deep%20links%20send%20mobile%20device,%2C%20Shopping%2C%20and%20Display%20campaigns.) or [universal link](https://developer.apple.com/ios/universal-links/). These links work on both Android and iOS. They enable seamless communication between the wallet and the app.

### Key Behavior to Address

In some scenarios, wallets use redirect metadata provided in session proposals to open applications. This can cause unintended behavior, such as:

Redirecting to the wrong app when multiple apps share the same redirect metadata (e.g., a desktop and mobile version of the same Dapp). Opening an unrelated application if a QR code is scanned on a different device than where the wallet is installed.

#### Recommended Approach

To avoid this behavior, wallets should:

*   **Restrict Redirect Metadata to Deep Link Use Cases**: Redirect metadata should only be used when the session proposal is initiated through a deep link. QR code scans should not trigger app redirects using session proposal metadata.

The connection and sign request flows are similar across platforms.

### Connection Flow

*   **Dapp Prompts User:** The Dapp asks the user to connect.
*   **User Chooses Wallet:** The user selects a wallet from a list of compatible wallets.
*   **Redirect to Wallet:** The user is redirected to their chosen wallet.
*   **Wallet Approval:** The wallet prompts the user to approve or reject the session (similar to granting permission).
*   **Return to Dapp:**
    *   **Manual Return:** The wallet asks the user to manually return to the Dapp.
    *   **Automatic Return:** Alternatively, the wallet automatically takes the user back to the Dapp.
*   **User Reunites with Dapp:** After all the interactions, the user ends up back in the Dapp.

### Sign Request Flow

When the Dapp needs the user to sign something (like a transaction), a similar pattern occurs:

*   **Automatic Redirect:** The Dapp automatically sends the user to their previously chosen wallet.
*   **Approval Prompt:** The wallet asks the user to approve or reject the request.
*   **Return to Dapp:**
    *   **Manual Return:** The wallet asks the user to manually return to the Dapp.
    *   **Automatic Return:** Alternatively, the wallet automatically takes the user back to the Dapp.
*   **User Reconnects:** Eventually, the user returns to the Dapp.

Platform preparations
---------------------

Since React Native leverages on native APIs, you must follow iOS and Android steps for each native platform

More information in official documentation: [https://reactnative.dev/docs/linking?syntax=android#enabling-deep-links](https://reactnative.dev/docs/linking?syntax=android#enabling-deep-links)

### How to test

Before submitting your project to the Cloud Explorer you can test mobile linking in our sample Dapp:

1.  On your mobile device, visit the appropriate link:

*   For EVM: [https://appkit-lab.reown.com/library/wagmi/](https://appkit-lab.reown.com/library/wagmi/)
*   For Solana: [https://appkit-lab.reown.com/library/solana/](https://appkit-lab.reown.com/library/solana/)

2.  Click the “Custom Wallet” button and fill in the form with your wallet information. The website will reload and your wallet will be stored locally.
3.  Click the “Connect Wallet” button and choose your mobile wallet. It _should_ automatically open and redirect to your wallet.

Learn more about mobile linking in the [Best Practices section](https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/best-practices#2-mobile-linking).

Integration
-----------

In order to redirect to the Dapp, you’ll need to use `Linking` from `react-native` and call `openURL()` method with the Dapp scheme that comes in the proposal metadata.</content>

  <title>Usage - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/react-native/usage</url>
  <content>This section provides instructions on how to initialize the WalletKit client, approve sessions with supported namespaces, and respond to session requests, enabling easy integration of Web3 wallets with dapps through a simple and intuitive interface.

Cloud Configuration
-------------------

Create a new project on Reown Cloud at [https://cloud.reown.com](https://cloud.reown.com/) and obtain a new project ID.

Initialization
--------------

Create a new instance from `Core` and initialize it with your `projectId`. Next, create a WalletKit instance by calling `init` on `WalletKit`. Passing in the options object containing metadata about the app.

The `pair` function will help us pair between the dapp and wallet and will be used shortly.

Session
-------

A session is a connection between a dapp and a wallet. It is established when a user approves a session proposal from a dapp. A session is active until the user disconnects from the dapp or the session expires.

### Namespace Builder

With WalletKit (and @walletconnect/utils) we’ve published a helper utility that greatly reduces the complexity of parsing the `required` and `optional` namespaces. It accepts as parameters a `session proposal` along with your user’s `chains/methods/events/accounts` and returns ready-to-use `namespaces` object.

Example usage

If your wallet supports multiple namespaces e.g. `eip155`,`cosmos` & `near` Your `supportedNamespaces` should look like the following example.

### Get Active Sessions

You can get the wallet active sessions using the `getActiveSessions` function.

### EVM methods & events

In @walletconnect/ethereum-provider, (our abstracted EVM SDK for apps) we support by default the following Ethereum methods and events:

### Session Approval

In order to connect with a dapp, you will need to receive a WalletConnect URI (WCURI) and this will talk to our protocol to facilitate a pairing session. Therefore, you will need a test dapp in order to communicate with the wallet. We recommend testing with our [React V2 Dapp](https://react-app.walletconnect.com/) as this is the most up-to-date development site.

In order to capture the WCURI, recommend having some sort of state management you will pass through a `TextInput` or QRcode instance.

The `session_proposal` event is emitted when a dapp initiates a new session with a user’s wallet. The event will include a `proposal` object with information about the dapp and requested permissions. The wallet should display a prompt for the user to approve or reject the session. If approved, call `approveSession` and pass in the `proposal.id` and requested `namespaces`.

The `pair` method initiates a WalletConnect pairing process with a dapp using the given `uri` (QR code from the dapps). To learn more about pairing, checkout out the [docs](https://specs.walletconnect.com/2.0/specs/clients/core/pairing/).

### Session Rejection

You can use the `getSDKError` function, which is available in the `@walletconnect/utils` for the rejection function [library](https://github.com/WalletConnect/walletconnect-monorepo/tree/v2.0/packages/utils).

### Responding to Session requests

The `session_request` event is triggered by a dapp when it needs the wallet to perform a specific action, such as signing a transaction. The event contains a `topic` and a `request` object, which will vary depending on the action requested.

To respond to the request, the wallet can access the `topic` and `request` object by destructuring them from the event payload. To see a list of possible `request` and `response` objects, refer to the relevant JSON-RPC Methods for [Ethereum](https://docs.reown.com/advanced/multichain/rpc-reference/ethereum-rpc.md), [Solana](https://docs.reown.com/advanced/multichain/rpc-reference/solana-rpc.md), [Cosmos](https://docs.reown.com/advanced/multichain/rpc-reference/cosmos-rpc.md), or [Stellar](https://docs.reown.com/advanced/multichain/rpc-reference/stellar-rpc.md).

As an example, if the dapp requests a `personal_sign` method, the wallet can extract the `params` array from the `request` object. The first item in the array is the hex version of the message to be signed, which can be converted to UTF-8 and assigned to a `message` variable. The second item in `params` is the user’s wallet address.

To sign the message, the wallet can use the `wallet.signMessage` method and pass in the message. The signed message, along with the `id` from the event payload, can then be used to create a `response` object, which can be passed into `respondSessionRequest`.

The wallet then signs the message. `signedMessage`, along with the `id` from the event payload, can then be used to create a `response` object, which can be passed into `respondSessionRequest`.

To reject a session request, the response should be similar to this.

### Updating a Session

The `session_update` event is emitted from the wallet when the session is updated by calling `updateSession`. To update a session, pass in the [topic](https://docs.reown.com/advanced/glossary#topics) and the new namespace.

### Extending a Session

To extend the session, call the `extendSession` method and pass in the new `topic`. The `session_update` event will be emitted from the wallet.

### Session Disconnect

When either the dapp or the wallet disconnects from a session, a `session_delete` event will be emitted. It’s important to subscribe to this event so you could keep your state up-to-date.

To initiate a session disconnect, call the `disconnectSession` method and pass in the `topic` and `reason`. You can use the `getSDKError` utility function, which is available in the `@walletconnect/utils` [library](https://github.com/WalletConnect/walletconnect-monorepo/tree/v2.0/packages/utils).

### Emitting Session Events

To emit session events, call the `emitSessionEvent` and pass in the params. If you wish to switch to chain/account that is not approved (missing from `session.namespaces`) you will have to update the session first. In the following example, the wallet will emit `session_event` that will instruct the dapp to switch the active accounts.

In the following example, the wallet will emit `session_event` when the wallet switches chains.</content>

  <title>Overview - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/react-native/notifications/notify/overview</url>
  <content>The WalletKit Notify API is designed to enhance the interaction between wallet users and dapps by offering a robust notification system. This API empowers wallet developers to implement a dynamic notification experience directly within their wallets. It provides the functionality for users to opt-in to notifications, ensuring they stay informed about critical events and interactions.

The Notify API is versatile, with support for both iOS and Android platforms, making it an ideal choice for cross-platform wallet applications.

Coupled with the [AppKit Notifications](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react-native/notifications/overview), the Notify API forms part of a comprehensive toolkit that enables seamless integration of web3 communication and messaging features into dapps. This ensures a more connected and interactive experience for users in the decentralized ecosystem.

Features
--------

Some of the key features of the Notify API include:

*   **Push Notifications for Desktop and Native Platforms**: This feature enables dapps to directly send vital notifications to user wallets, ensuring timely and relevant communication.
*   **Robust Spam Protection**: Users have complete authority over which dapps can send them notifications, effectively eliminating any unsolicited messages from unknown sources. Furthermore, users can fine-tune their preferences to only receive notifications types they are interested in, like new features or some important events occurrence.
*   **Chain Agnostic Architecture**: The Notify API is built to be compatible with any blockchain, allowing seamless multi-chain support without the need for writing additional integration code. **As of November 2023, the Notify Server and Clients are equipped to support EVM chains. Plans to extend support to non-EVM chains are in progress and are a significant part of our upcoming development roadmap.**

  <title>Link Mode - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/react-native/link-mode</url>
  <content>WalletKit Link Mode is a low latency mechanism for transporting [One-Click Auth](https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/react-native/one-click-auth) requests and session requests over Universal Links, reducing the need for a WebSocket connection with the Relay. This significantly enhances the user experience when connecting native dApps to native wallets by reducing the latency associated with network connections, especially when the user has an unstable internet connection.

### How to enable it:

To support Link Mode add a universal link for your wallet in Cloud project configuration [dashboard](https://cloud.reown.com/sign-in), configure your Metadata with a valid universal link and set the `linkMode` property to `true`:

### Platform specifics:

To enable universal links for your app, refer to [React Native Documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/linking?syntax=ios#enabling-deep-links).  

After following the steps provided in the official guide:

1.  Ensure that you handle incoming Universal Links in the your `AppDelegate.mm` file.

2.  Open your project in XCode and go to `Settings/Signing & Capabilities/Associated Domains` to add the new domain. After this, `your_project.entitlement` should look like this:

3.  Update/Create your domain’s `.well-known/apple-app-site-association` file accordingly.

For more information about supporting universal links, visit the [Supporting associated domains](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/supporting-associated-domains?language=objc) page

For a debugging guide, visit the [Debugging Universal Links](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3155-debugging-universal-links) page.  

Once everything is properly configured, and the user interacts with a Link Mode-supporting dApp, your wallet will receive requests through it.

  <title>Best Practices - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/react-native/best-practices</url>
  <content>The purpose of this guide is to show the best practices in regards of the WalletKit client usage. The goal is to provide the best user experience that just works in every circumstances.

Pairing
-------

A pairing is a connection between a wallet and a dapp that has fixed permissions to only allow a dapp to propose a session through it. Dapp can propose infinite number of sessions on one pairing. Wallet must use a pair method from the WalletKit client to pair with dapp.

### Pairing Expiry

A pairing expiry event is triggered whenever a pairing is expired. The expiry for inactive pairing is 5 mins, whereas for active pairing is 30 days. A pairing becomes active when a session proposal is received and user successfully approves it. This event helps to know when given pairing expires and update UI accordingly.

### Expected User flow

### Pairing Flow

### Pairing Error

### Expected Errors

While pairing the following errors might occur:

*   No Internet connection error or pairing timeout when scanning QR with no Internet connection
    *   User should pair again with Internet connection
*   Pairing expired error when scanning a QR code with expired pairing
    *   User should refresh a QR code and scan again
*   Pairing with existing pairing is not allowed
    *   User should refresh a QR code and scan again. I usually happens when user scans an already paired QR code.

Session Proposal
----------------

A session proposal is a handshake sent by a dapp and it’s purpose is to define a session rules. Whenever a user wants to establish a connection between a wallet and a dapp, one should approve a session proposal.

### User Action Feedback

Whenever user approves or rejects a session proposal, wallet should show loading indicators in a moment of the button press until Relay acknowledgement is received for any of this actions.

Approving session

Rejecting session

### Session Proposal Expiry

A session proposal expiry is 5 mins. It means a given proposal is stored for 5 mins in the SDK storage and user has 5 mins for approval or rejection decision. After that time the below event is emitted and proposal modal should be removed from the app’s UI.

### Expected User flow

### Approve or Reject Session Proposal

### Error Handling

### Expected Errors

While approving or rejecting a session proposal the following errors might occurs:

*   No Internet connection
    *   It happens when a user tries to approve or reject session proposal with no Internet connection
*   Session proposal expired
    *   It happens when users tries to approve or reject expired session proposal
*   Invalid namespaces
    *   It happens when a validation of session namespaces fails
*   Timeout
    *   It happens when Relay doesn’t acknowledge session settle publish within 10s

Session Request
---------------

A session request represents the request sent by a dapp to a wallet.

### User Action Feedback

Whenever user approves or rejects a session request, wallet should show loading indicators in a moment of the button press until Relay acknowledgement is received for any of this actions.

### Session Request Expiry

A session request expiry is defined by a dapp. It’s value must be between now() + 5mins and now() + 7 days. After the session request expires the below event is emitted and session request modal should be removed from the app’s UI.

### Expected User flow

### Approve or Reject Session Proposal

### Error Handling

### Expected Errors

While approving or rejecting a session request the following error might occur:

*   Invalid session
    *   This error might happen when user approves or rejects a session request on expired session
*   Session request expired
    *   This error might happen when user approves or rejects a session request that already expires
*   Timeout
    *   It happens when Relay doesn’t acknowledge session settle publish within 10s

Web Socket Connection State
---------------------------

The Web Socket connection state tracks the connection with the relay server, event is emitted whenever a connection state changes.

### Expected User flow

### Connection State</content>

<page>
  <title>Verify - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/react-native/cloud/verify</url>
  <content>Verify API is a security-focused feature that allows wallets to notify end-users when they may be connecting to a suspicious or malicious domain, helping to prevent phishing attacks across the industry.

Once a wallet knows whether an end-user is on uniswap.com or eviluniswap.com, it can help them to detect potentially harmful connections through Verify’s combined offering of Reown’s domain registry.

Cloud Verification
------------------

In order to verify your app domain in Reown Cloud follow these steps:

1.  Head over to [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/)
    
2.  Create a new project or click on the project you would like to verify.
    
3.  On the settings tab, head over to the ‘Domain verification’ section and fill in the website URL that you wish to verify.
    

4.  Click on the copy button and head over to your domain Name Registrar/Provider to edit your DNS records. Alternatively, if you can’t manage DNS records for your project (eg: ENS or vercel.app) you can host a static file under `/.well-known/walletconnect.txt` which contains the entire verification code that you copied. If you are using the static file method, you can jump over step 7.
    
5.  Under `Type`, select `TXT`. In the “Answer” section, paste the text you copied from the cloud dashboard. This field may vary across DNS dashboards. If you’re trying to register a subdomain, add it under `Host`. Feel free to leave TTL at its default value.
    

6.  Depending on your DNS settings, this might take a while to reflect. You can check out DNS settings for your website with CLI tools like Dig or with websites like [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=txt)
    
7.  Once this is done and you have confirmed this change is reflected, head on back to your Cloud Dashboard and click on Verify.
    

8.  You should see a toast pop up in the bottom right section of your screen and the domain verification section should have a green tick next to it.</content>

  <title>Relay - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/react-native/cloud/relay</url>
  <content>Project ID
----------

The Project ID is consumed through URL parameters.

URL parameters used:

*   `projectId`: Your Project ID can be obtained from [cloud.reown.com](https://cloud.reown.com/)

Example URL:

`https://relay.walletconnect.com/?projectId=c4f79cc821944d9680842e34466bfbd`

This can be instantiated from the client with the `projectId` in the `SignClient` constructor.

Allowlist
---------

To help prevent malicious use of your project ID you are strongly encouraged to set an allowlist of [origins](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin) or application/bundle ids for mobile applications where the project ID is used. Requests from other origins will be denied.

*   Allowlist supports a list of origins in the format `[scheme://]<hostname[:port]`.
*   [Application ID](https://developer.android.com/build/configure-app-module#set-application-id)/[Bundle IDs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/bundle_ids) typically are defined using the [reverse domain name notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation)

Using `localhost` (or `127.0.0.1`) is always permitted, and if empty all origins are allowed. Updates take 15 minutes to apply.

If scheme or port is specified, it must match exactly. Hostname must also match exactly, but wildcards can be used for individual labels within the hostname.

Example of possible origins in the allowlist:

*   `example.com` - allows `https://example.com` or `http://example.com` but not `https://www.example.com`
*   `https://example.com` - allows `https://example.com` but not `http://example.com`
*   `https://www.example.com` - allows `https://www.example.com` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://example.com:8080` - allows `https://example.com:8080` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://*.example.com` - allows `https://www.example.com` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://*.*.example.com` - allows `https://www.subdomain.example.com` but not `https://www.example.com` or `https://example.com`
*   `https://www.*.example.com` - allows `https://www.subdomain.example.com` but not `https://www.example.com`
*   `https://www-*.example.com` - invalid; `*` must be the full label

Error Codes
-----------

| Reason | Error Code |
| --- | --- |
| Project ID doesn’t exist OR JWT is expired | 401 |
| Exists and is invalid | 403 |
| Too many requests | 1013 |

Websocket Close Codes
---------------------

| Code | Description | Reconnect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1001 | Server terminating | Yes |
| 4008 | Client stale: connected without a prior subscription and is not sending data | When needed |
| 4010 | Load Rebalancing | Yes |

Best Practices
--------------

*   Create a new `projectId` for each project. This allows for more granular control, dedicated explorer listings, and project metrics.
*   Don’t reuse a `projectId`.
*   Use the AllowList to limit unauthorized usage.
*   Avoid committing projects keys to the repo. Use env variables instead.

  <title>Link Mode - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/ios/link-mode</url>
  <content>WalletKit Link Mode is a low latency mechanism for transporting [One-Click Auth](https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/ios/one-click-auth) requests and session requests over Universal Links, reducing the need for a WebSocket connection with the Relay. This significantly enhances the user experience when connecting native dApps to native wallets by reducing the latency associated with network connections, especially when the user has an unstable internet connection.

To support Link Mode add a universal link for your wallet in Cloud project configuration dashboard, configure your `AppMetadata.Redirect` with a valid universal link and set the `linkMode` property to `true`:

Once link mode and universal linking are properly configured and the user interacts with a link mode supporting dApp, your wallet will receive requests over universal linking. You must pass these requests to WalletKit so it can process them:

Ensure to handle incoming universal links in different methods of `AppDelegate` or `SceneDelegate`.

For more information on how to configure universal links for your app, refer to the [Apple Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/allowing-apps-and-websites-to-link-to-your-content?language=objc).

For a debugging guide, visit the [Debugging Universal Links](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3155-debugging-universal-links) page.

You can also find this [article](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/supporting-universal-links-in-your-app?language=objc) helpful.</content>

Initialization
--------------

Confirm you have configured the [Network Client](https://docs.reown.com/advanced/api/core/relay) first.

Starting from WalletConnect SDK version 1.9.5, the `redirect` field in the `AppMetadata` object is mandatory. Ensure that the provided value matches your app’s URL scheme to prevent redirection-related issues.

Once you’re done, in order to initialize a client just call a `configure` method from the WalletKit instance wrapper

In order to allow users to receive push notifications you have to communicate with Apple Push Notification service and receive unique device token. Register that token with following method:

The telemetry feature aims to enhance the reliability and observability of connection flows between decentralized applications (dApps) and wallets. It focuses solely on collecting data related to code execution and error codes, without tracking any sensitive user information such as amounts, accounts, etc.

It provides a comprehensive tracing system for three key use cases:

*   Subscribing to a Pairing Topic
*   Approving a Session
*   Approving an Authenticated Session

Each execution trace consists of:

*   Trace Events: Collected to verify the proper execution of code.
*   Error Events: Captured when errors occur during the trace, halting the execution trace.

When an error event is encountered, it is stored locally within the SDK along with all preceding trace events. These stored events are then transmitted to the server whenever the SDK is initialized.

Error event tracing is enabled by default.

**Telemetry Enabled (telemetryEnabled = true):**

*   The SDK stores events and sends them to the server.

**Telemetry Disabled (telemetryEnabled = false):**

*   The SDK stops storing new events and deletes all unsent events from local storage upon the next initialization.

Important Note: Since the SDK only stores abstract trace and error data, user identification is not possible.

Example of the error events:

Session
-------

A session is a connection between a dapp and a wallet. It is established when a user approves a session proposal from a dapp. A session is active until the user disconnects from the dapp or the session expires.

### Namespace Builder

`AutoNamespaces` is a helper utility that greatly reduces the complexity of parsing the required and optional namespaces. It accepts as parameters a session proposal along with your user’s chains/methods/events/accounts and returns ready-to-use `SessionNamespace` object.

Example usage

### EVM methods & events

In @walletconnect/ethereum-provider, (our abstracted EVM SDK for apps) we support by default the following Ethereum methods and events:

### Session Approval

When session is successfully approved `sessionsPublishers` will publish a `Session`

`Session` object represents an active session connection with a dapp. It contains dapp’s metadata (that you may want to use for displaying an active session to the user), namespaces, and expiry date. There is also a topic property that you will use for linking requests with related sessions.

You can always query settled sessions from the client later with:

#### Connect Clients

Your Wallet should allow users to scan a QR code generated by dapps. You are responsible for implementing it on your own. For testing, you can use our test dapp at: [https://react-app.walletconnect.com/](https://react-app.walletconnect.com/), which is v2 protocol compliant. Once you derive a URI from the QR code call `pair` method:

if everything goes well, you should handle following event:

Session proposal is a handshake sent by a dapp and it’s purpose is to define a session rules. Handshake procedure is defined by [CAIP-25](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-25.md). `Session.Proposal` object conveys set of required and optional `ProposalNamespaces` that contains blockchains methods and events. Dapp requests with methods and wallet will emit events defined in namespaces.

`VerifyContext` provides a domain verification information about `Session.Proposal` and `Request`. It consists of origin of a Dapp from where the request has been sent, validation enum that says whether origin is **unknown**, **valid** or **invalid** and verify URL server.

To enable or disable verification find the **Verify SDK** toggle in your project [cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/).

The user will either approve the session proposal (with session namespaces) or reject it. Session namespaces must at least contain requested methods, events and accounts associated with proposed blockchains.

Accounts must be provided according to [CAIP10](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-10.md) specification and be prefixed with a chain identifier. chain\_id + : + account\_address. You can find more on blockchain identifiers in [CAIP2](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-2.md). Our `Account` type meets the criteria.

Accounts sent in session approval must at least match all requested blockchains.

Example proposal namespaces request:

Example session namespaces response:

#### Track Sessions

When your `WalletKit` instance receives requests from a peer it will publish a related event. Set a subscription to handle them.

To track sessions subscribe to `sessionsPublisher` publisher

### Session Rejection

### Responding to Session requests

After the session is established, a dapp will request your wallet’s users to sign a transaction or a message. Requests will be delivered by the following publisher.

When a wallet receives a session request, you probably want to show it to the user. It’s method will be in scope of session namespaces. And it’s params are represented by `AnyCodable` type. An expected object can be derived as follows:

Now, your wallet (as it owns your user’s private keys) is responsible for signing the transaction. After doing it, you can send a response to a dapp.

### Updating a Session

If you want to update user session’s chains, accounts, methods or events you can use session update method.

### Extending a Session

By default, session lifetime is set for 7 days and after that time user’s session will expire. But if you consider that a session should be extended you can call:

Above method will extend a user’s session to a week.

### Session Disconnect

For good user experience your wallet should allow users to disconnect unwanted sessions. In order to terminate a session use `disconnect` method.

### Subscribe for WalletKit Publishers

The following publishers are available to subscribe:

### Register Device Token

To register a wallet to receive WalletConnect push notifications, call `register` method and pass the device token received from the `didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken` method in the `AppDelegate`.</content>

  <title>Push Notifications - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/ios/notifications/push</url>
  <content>WalletKit provides the functionality for wallets to receive push notifications through Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) and Apple Push Notification Service (APNs) via the Push Server. This feature ensures that wallets are promptly notified of incoming signature requests. Each push notification contains the encrypted details of the signature request. Upon receiving the notification, it can be decrypted and presented to the developer, allowing for customization of the message according to their requirements.

Server setup
------------

For the push notifications to be forwarded to FCM or APNs, the [Push Server](https://docs.reown.com/advanced/push-server) will need to be configured with your FCM or APNs server API credentials.

App setup
---------

### Register the device token

To enable a device for push notifications, it’s essential to register the device token using `WalletKit.registerDeviceToken`. This token can be obtained from either FCM or APNS, depending on the platform used.

In your AppDelegate, you need to register your device token for push notifications. To enable encrypted push notifications, set the `enableEncrypted` flag to `true`.

### Receiving push notifications

After the device token is registered, the next step involves setting up the notification service specific to the platform being used. This service will decrypt the incoming requests and forward them to the developer for further processing and integration.

When using encrypted push notifications via APNs, the payload will look like this:

To decrypt a push notification, follow these steps:

1.  Instantiate [UNNotificationServiceExtension](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unnotificationserviceextension)
    
2.  Modify the content of newly delivered notifications. Learn more about [modifying content in newly delivered notifications](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/modifying_content_in_newly_delivered_notifications).
    
3.  Create a Shared [Keychain Group](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services/keychain_items/sharing_access_to_keychain_items_among_a_collection_of_apps)
    

Ensure you have a keychain group that is shared between your wallet application and the notification service. This is set in the app during the Networking Client configuration as shown below:

4.  Instantiate WalletKitDecryptionService

Use the same group name inside your notification service extension.

`handleWalletKitNotification` and `handleNotifyNotification` methods can be found in our [Sample App](https://github.com/reown-com/reown-swift/blob/main/Example/PNDecryptionService/NotificationService.swift)</content>

  <title>Chain Abstraction - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/ios/early-access/chain-abstraction</url>
  <content>Chain Abstraction in WalletKit enables users with stablecoins on any network to spend them on-the-fly on a different network. Our Chain Abstraction solution provides a toolkit for wallet developers to integrate this complex functionality using WalletKit.

For example, when an app requests a 100 USDC payment on Base network but the user only has USDC on Arbitrum, WalletKit offers methods to detect this mismatch, generate necessary transactions, track the cross-chain transfer, and complete the original transaction after bridging finishes.

How It Works
------------

When sending a transaction, you need to:

1.  Check if the required chain has enough funds to complete the transaction
2.  If not, use the `prepare` method to generate necessary bridging transactions
3.  Sign routing and initial transaction hashes, prepared by the prepare method
4.  Invoke `execute` method to broadcast routing and initial transactions and wait for it to be completed

The following sequence diagram illustrates the complete flow of a chain abstraction operation, from the initial dapp request to the final transaction confirmation

Methods
-------

Following are the methods from WalletKit that you will use in implementing chain abstraction.

### Prepare

This method is used to check if chain abstraction is needed. If it is, it will return a response with the necessary transactions. If it is not, it will return a response with the original transaction.

### Execute

This method is used to execute the chain abstraction operation. The method will handle broadcasting all transactions in the correct order and monitor the cross-chain transfer process. It returns an `ExecuteDetails` object with the transaction status and results.

Usage
-----

When sending a transaction, first check if chain abstraction is needed using the `prepare` method. Call the `execute` method to broadcast the routing and initial transactions and wait for it to be completed.

If the operation is successful, you need to broadcast the initial transaction and await the transaction hash and receipt. If the operation is not successful, send a JsonRpcError to the dapp and display the error to the user.

For example, check out implementation of chain abstraction in [sample wallet](https://github.com/reown-com/reown-swift/blob/develop/Example/WalletApp/PresentationLayer/Wallet/CATransactionModal/CATransactionPresenter.swift) with Swift.

Testing
-------

Best way to test Chain Abstraction is to use [sample wallet](https://testflight.apple.com/join/09bTAryp). You can also use the [AppKit laboratory](https://appkit-lab.reown.com/library/wagmi/) and try sending [USDC/USDT](https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/features/early-access/chain-abstraction.mdx#what-are-the-supported-tokens-and-networks) with any chain abstraction-supported wallet.</content>

  <title>Best Practices - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/ios/best-practices</url>
  <content>The purpose of this guide is to show the best practices in regards of the WalletKit client usage. The goal is to provide the best user experience that just works in every circumstances.

Pairing
-------

A pairing is a connection between a wallet and a dapp that has fixed permissions to only allow a dapp to propose a session through it. Dapp can propose infinite number of sessions on one pairing. Wallet must use a pair method from the WalletKit client to pair with dapp.

### Pairing State

A pairing state is a primitive exposed by the WalletKit client for a wallet to indicate whether it should await a session proposal. The pairing state is `true` when a wallet scans a QR and awaits a session proposal. Once the session proposal is received by the wallet, the pairing state is changed to `false`. When `true` wallet should show a loading indicator awaiting a session proposal, when changed to `false` a proposal dialog should be displayed.

### Pairing Expiry

A pairing expiry event is triggered whenever a pairing is expired. The expiry for inactive pairing is 5 mins, whereas for active pairing is 30 days. A pairing becomes active when a session proposal is received and user successfully approves it. This event helps to know when given pairing expires and update UI accordingly.

### Expected User flow

### Pairing Flow

### Pairing Error

### Expected Errors

While pairing the following errors might occur:

*   No Internet connection error or pairing timeout when scanning QR with no Internet connection
    *   User should pair again with Internet connection
*   Pairing expired error when scanning a QR code with expired pairing
    *   User should refresh a QR code and scan again
*   Pairing with existing pairing is not allowed
    *   User should refresh a QR code and scan again. I usually happens when user scans an already paired QR code.

Session Proposal
----------------

A session proposal is a handshake sent by a dapp and it’s purpose is to define a session rules. Whenever a user wants to establish a connection between a wallet and a dapp, one should approve a session proposal.

### User Action Feedback

Whenever user approves or rejects a session proposal, wallet should show loading indicators in a moment of the button press until Relay acknowledgement is received for any of this actions.

Session Approve

Session Reject

### Session Proposal Expiry

A session proposal expiry is 5 mins. It means a given proposal is stored for 5 mins in the SDK storage and user has 5 mins for approval or rejection decision. After that time the below event is emitted and proposal modal should be removed from the app’s UI.

### Expected User flow

### Approve or Reject Session Proposal

### Error Handling

### Expected Errors

While approving or rejecting a session proposal the following errors might occurs:

*   No Internet connection
    *   It happens when a user tries to approve or reject session proposal with no Internet connection
*   Session proposal expired
    *   It happens when users tries to approve or reject expired session proposal
*   Invalid namespaces
    *   It happens when a validation of session namespaces fails
*   Timeout
    *   It happens when Relay doesn’t acknowledge session settle publish within 10s

Session Request
---------------

A session request represents the request sent by a dapp to a wallet.

### User Action Feedback

Whenever user approves or rejects a session request, wallet should show loading indicators in a moment of the button press until Relay acknowledgement is received for any of this actions.

### Session Request Expiry

A session request expiry is defined by a dapp. It’s value must be between now() + 5mins and now() + 7 days. After the session request expires the below event is emitted and session request modal should be removed from the app’s UI.

### Expected User flow

### Approve or Reject Session Proposal

### Error Handling

### Expected Errors

While approving or rejecting a session request the following error might occur:

*   Invalid session
    *   This error might happen when user approves or rejects a session request on expired session
*   Session request expired
    *   This error might happen when user approves or rejects a session request that already expires
*   Timeout
    *   It happens when Relay doesn’t acknowledge session settle publish within 10s

Web Socket Connection State
---------------------------

The Web Socket connection state tracks the connection with the relay server, event is emitted whenever a connection state changes.

How do we test wallets?
-----------------------

In order to offer a great user experience in our APIs and SDKs every Cloud submission goes through a QA process to make sure that the integration of the WalletConnect protocol is working correctly.

The following list details our QA flow and how to reproduce it:

| Test Case | Steps | Expected Results |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Set Up** | 1\. Download the wallet  
2\. Install the wallet app  
3\. Sign up for an account with the wallet app  
4\. Create one or more accounts | 1\. N/A  
2\. The app is installed  
3\. I have an account  
4\. I have one or more accounts |
| **Connect to dapp via web browser** | 1\. Open the Reown connection page [https://appkit-lab.reown.com/](https://appkit-lab.reown.com/) from a PC  
2\. Press on the “Connect Wallet” button and select the Reown option.  
3\. Open the wallet app and use the scan QR option to connect.  
4\. Accept on the wallet the connection request | 1\. The app has been correctly set-up  
2\. A modal with wallet options is opened  
3\. A QR code is shown on the website and the wallet is able to scan it.  
4\. The connection is successfully established. The wallet data is now shown on the website. |
| **Connect to dapp via mobile browser (Deep-link)** | 1\. Open [https://appkit-lab.reown.com/](https://appkit-lab.reown.com/) in your mobile device.  
2\. Select one of the default options (e.g. Wagmi for EVM chains). Press the “Custom Wallet” button from the navbar. Fill in the wallet’s name and its deeplink (Mobile Link) in the “Add a Custom Wallet” form. Press “Add Wallet”. After the website reloads, press the “Connect Wallet” button and select the newly created wallet.  
3\. Accept the connection request in the wallet application. | 1\. N/A  
2\. A form should show up on the website to fill in the wallet’s data. After the changes are applied, the modal should show the newly created wallet on the main view.  
3\. The user should be redirected to the wallet application and a modal with a connection request should show up on the wallet application. The wallet should connect successfully. On Android devices, the user should be redirected back to the website after accepting the connection request. |
| **Switch chains - dapp side** | 1\. Once the wallet is connected, press on the modal button on the top right of the website.  
2\. Press the first button of the modal to switch the chain.  
3\. Select any available chain, close the modal, and press the “Send Transaction” button | 1\. A modal with the account information should pop up on the website.  
2\. A new view with supported chains should show up.  
3\. The transaction request that pops up on the wallet should show in their information the correct chain that was previously selected. |
| **Switch Chains - wallet side (if supported)** | 1\. Check if the wallet supports chain switching. If so, select a different chain from the connected one. | 1\. The chain change should be reflected on the website. The first card shows the current chain ID. |
| **Accounts Switching - wallet side** | 1\. In the wallet app, switch from one account to another. | 1\. The account switch event should be reflected in the modal’s account view on the website. |
| **Disconnect a wallet** | 1\. Select the “Disconnect” button from the Wallet App (Ideally, wallets should have a section where users can see all their existing dApp connections and manage/disconnect from dApps in one spot—this is not always true, so if not possible, just skip this).  
2\. Repeat the above steps and press the “Disconnect” button from the dApp (this should always be available). | 1\. The related session should disappear from the dApp and the Wallet App.  
2\. The related session should disappear from the dApp and the Wallet App. |
| **Verify API** | 1\. Open [https://malicious-app-verify-simulation.vercel.app/](https://malicious-app-verify-simulation.vercel.app/)

  <title>Verify - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/ios/cloud/verify</url>
  <content>Verify API is a security-focused feature that allows wallets to notify end-users when they may be connecting to a suspicious or malicious domain, helping to prevent phishing attacks across the industry.

Once a wallet knows whether an end-user is on uniswap.com or eviluniswap.com, it can help them to detect potentially harmful connections through Verify’s combined offering of Reown’s domain registry.

Cloud Verification
------------------

In order to verify your app domain in Reown Cloud follow these steps:

1.  Head over to [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/)
    
2.  Create a new project or click on the project you would like to verify.
    
3.  On the settings tab, head over to the ‘Domain verification’ section and fill in the website URL that you wish to verify.
    

4.  Click on the copy button and head over to your domain Name Registrar/Provider to edit your DNS records. Alternatively, if you can’t manage DNS records for your project (eg: ENS or vercel.app) you can host a static file under `/.well-known/walletconnect.txt` which contains the entire verification code that you copied. If you are using the static file method, you can jump over step 7.
    
5.  Under `Type`, select `TXT`. In the “Answer” section, paste the text you copied from the cloud dashboard. This field may vary across DNS dashboards. If you’re trying to register a subdomain, add it under `Host`. Feel free to leave TTL at its default value.
    

6.  Depending on your DNS settings, this might take a while to reflect. You can check out DNS settings for your website with CLI tools like Dig or with websites like [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=txt)
    
7.  Once this is done and you have confirmed this change is reflected, head on back to your Cloud Dashboard and click on Verify.
    

8.  You should see a toast pop up in the bottom right section of your screen and the domain verification section should have a green tick next to it.</content>

  <title>Push Notifications - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/react-native/notifications/push</url>
  <content>WalletKit provides the functionality for wallets to receive push notifications through Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) and Apple Push Notification Service (APNs) via the Push Server. This feature ensures that wallets are promptly notified of incoming signature requests. Each push notification contains the encrypted details of the signature request. Upon receiving the notification, it can be decrypted and presented to the developer, allowing for customization of the message according to their requirements.

Server setup
------------

For the push notifications to be forwarded to FCM or APNs, the [Push Server](https://docs.reown.com/advanced/push-server) will need to be configured with your FCM or APNs server API credentials.

App setup
---------

### Register the device token

To enable a device for push notifications, it’s essential to register the device token using `walletKit.registerDeviceToken`. This token can be obtained from either FCM or APNS, depending on the platform used.

To receive push notifications from WalletConnect’s Push Server via Firebase Cloud Messaging, you will need to setup Firebase in your project. You can follow their documentation - [Firebase documentation](https://rnfirebase.io/messaging/usage#installation). Once you have Firebase configured, you can obtain the device token by calling `messaging().getToken()`. This unique token is used to identify each device.

The device token will be used to register for WalletConnect push notifications by calling `walletKit.registerDeviceToken` and passing the token as an argument. The `registerDeviceToken` should be called every time the client is initialized.

With that the base setup is complete and you can start receiving push notifications from WalletConnect’s Push Server for your sessions.

Note, that from time to time, the device token is refreshed, so you must make sure to register it again.

### Receiving push notifications

After the device token is registered, the next step involves setting up the notification service specific to the platform being used. This service will decrypt the incoming requests and forward them to the developer for further processing and integration.

To receive the actual push notifications, you will need to subscribe to firebase messaging events.

Now that we have the notifications listeners setup, we can start processing the incoming notifications.</content>

  <title>Relay - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/ios/cloud/relay</url>
  <content>Project ID
----------

The Project ID is consumed through URL parameters.

URL parameters used:

*   `projectId`: Your Project ID can be obtained from [cloud.reown.com](https://cloud.reown.com/)

Example URL:

`https://relay.walletconnect.com/?projectId=c4f79cc821944d9680842e34466bfbd`

This can be instantiated from the client with the `projectId` in the `SignClient` constructor.

Allowlist
---------

To help prevent malicious use of your project ID you are strongly encouraged to set an allowlist of [origins](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin) or application/bundle ids for mobile applications where the project ID is used. Requests from other origins will be denied.

*   Allowlist supports a list of origins in the format `[scheme://]<hostname[:port]`.
*   [Application ID](https://developer.android.com/build/configure-app-module#set-application-id)/[Bundle IDs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/bundle_ids) typically are defined using the [reverse domain name notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation)

Using `localhost` (or `127.0.0.1`) is always permitted, and if empty all origins are allowed. Updates take 15 minutes to apply.

If scheme or port is specified, it must match exactly. Hostname must also match exactly, but wildcards can be used for individual labels within the hostname.

Example of possible origins in the allowlist:

*   `example.com` - allows `https://example.com` or `http://example.com` but not `https://www.example.com`
*   `https://example.com` - allows `https://example.com` but not `http://example.com`
*   `https://www.example.com` - allows `https://www.example.com` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://example.com:8080` - allows `https://example.com:8080` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://*.example.com` - allows `https://www.example.com` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://*.*.example.com` - allows `https://www.subdomain.example.com` but not `https://www.example.com` or `https://example.com`
*   `https://www.*.example.com` - allows `https://www.subdomain.example.com` but not `https://www.example.com`
*   `https://www-*.example.com` - invalid; `*` must be the full label

Error Codes
-----------

| Reason | Error Code |
| --- | --- |
| Project ID doesn’t exist OR JWT is expired | 401 |
| Exists and is invalid | 403 |
| Too many requests | 1013 |

Websocket Close Codes
---------------------

| Code | Description | Reconnect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1001 | Server terminating | Yes |
| 4008 | Client stale: connected without a prior subscription and is not sending data | When needed |
| 4010 | Load Rebalancing | Yes |

Best Practices
--------------

*   Create a new `projectId` for each project. This allows for more granular control, dedicated explorer listings, and project metrics.
*   Don’t reuse a `projectId`.
*   Use the AllowList to limit unauthorized usage.
*   Avoid committing projects keys to the repo. Use env variables instead.

*   [Project ID](#project-id)

  <title>Link Mode - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/flutter/link-mode</url>
  <content>WalletKit Link Mode is a low latency mechanism for transporting [One-Click Auth](https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/flutter/one-click-auth) requests and session requests over Universal Links, reducing the need for a WebSocket connection with the Relay. This significantly enhances the user experience when connecting native dApps to native wallets by reducing the latency associated with network connections, especially when the user has an unstable internet connection.

By enabling it, the wallet and dapp will communicate through declared Universal Links on iOS and/or App Links on Android **even without an internet connection.**

### How to enable it:

1.  Add a Universal Link for your wallet in the **Explorer** tab of your [**Cloud project configuration**](https://cloud.reown.com/sign-in), under the **Mobile Linking** section
    
2.  Configure your `PairingMetadata`’s `redirect:` object with that Universal Link
    
3.  Set the `linkMode` property to `true`:
    

Once everything is properly configured, and the user interacts with a Link Mode-supporting dApp, your wallet will receive requests through it.

In Flutter, there are several plugins that can help you integrate Universal/App Links. However, regardless of which one you choose, it is crucial that, when capturing an incoming link, you pass it to WalletKit so it can process the request.

### Platform specifics:

1.  Ensure that you handle incoming Universal Links in the appropriate methods of `AppDelegate` or `SceneDelegate`.
2.  Ensure that you have enabled the Associated Domains Capability in your XCode project and that your Universal Link is properly configured. _(Depending on the previous states of your Provisioning Profiles it may be necessary to update or create new ones)_

3.  Update/Create your domain’s `.well-known/apple-app-site-association` file accordingly.

For more information on how to configure universal links for your app, refer to the [Apple Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/allowing-apps-and-websites-to-link-to-your-content?language=swift).  
For a debugging guide, visit the [Debugging Universal Links](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3155-debugging-universal-links) page.

  <title>Wallet Call API - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/flutter/eip5792</url>
  <content>WalletConnect supports [EIP-5792](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5792#atomicbatch-capability), which defines new JSON-RPC methods that enable apps to ask a wallet to process a batch of onchain write calls and to check on the status of those calls. Applications can specify that these onchain calls be executed taking advantage of specific capabilities previously expressed by the wallet; an additional, a novel wallet RPC is defined to enable apps to query the wallet for those capabilities.

*   `wallet_sendCalls`: Requests that a wallet submits a batch of calls.
*   `wallet_getCallsStatus`: Returns the status of a call batch that was sent via wallet\_sendCalls.
*   `wallet_showCallsStatus`: Requests that a wallet shows information about a given call bundle that was sent with wallet\_sendCalls.
*   `wallet_getCapabilities`: This RPC allows an application to request capabilities from a wallet (e.g. batch transactions, paymaster communication).</content>

  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/flutter/cloud/relay</url>
  <content>Project ID
----------

The Project ID is consumed through URL parameters.

URL parameters used:

*   `projectId`: Your Project ID can be obtained from [cloud.reown.com](https://cloud.reown.com/)

Example URL:

`https://relay.walletconnect.com/?projectId=c4f79cc821944d9680842e34466bfbd`

This can be instantiated from the client with the `projectId` in the `SignClient` constructor.

Allowlist
---------

To help prevent malicious use of your project ID you are strongly encouraged to set an allowlist of [origins](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin) or application/bundle ids for mobile applications where the project ID is used. Requests from other origins will be denied.

*   Allowlist supports a list of origins in the format `[scheme://]<hostname[:port]`.
*   [Application ID](https://developer.android.com/build/configure-app-module#set-application-id)/[Bundle IDs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/bundle_ids) typically are defined using the [reverse domain name notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation)

Using `localhost` (or `127.0.0.1`) is always permitted, and if empty all origins are allowed. Updates take 15 minutes to apply.

If scheme or port is specified, it must match exactly. Hostname must also match exactly, but wildcards can be used for individual labels within the hostname.

Example of possible origins in the allowlist:

*   `example.com` - allows `https://example.com` or `http://example.com` but not `https://www.example.com`
*   `https://example.com` - allows `https://example.com` but not `http://example.com`
*   `https://www.example.com` - allows `https://www.example.com` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://example.com:8080` - allows `https://example.com:8080` but not `https://example.com`

Best Practices
--------------

*   Create a new `projectId` for each project. This allows for more granular control, dedicated explorer listings, and project metrics.
*   Don’t reuse a `projectId`.
*   Use the AllowList to limit unauthorized usage.
*   Avoid committing projects keys to the repo. Use env variables instead.

How do we test wallets?
-----------------------

In order to offer a great user experience in our APIs and SDKs every Cloud submission goes through a QA process to make sure that the integration of the WalletConnect protocol is working correctly.

The following list details our QA flow and how to reproduce it:

| Test Case | Steps | Expected Results |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Set Up** | 1\. Download the wallet  
2\. Install the wallet app  
3\. Sign up for an account with the wallet app  
4\. Create one or more accounts | 1\. N/A  
2\. The app is installed  
3\. I have an account  
4\. I have one or more accounts |
| **Connect to dapp via web browser** | 1\. Open the Reown connection page [https://appkit-lab.reown.com/](https://appkit-lab.reown.com/) from a PC  
2\. Press on the “Connect Wallet” button and select the Reown option.  
3\. Open the wallet app and use the scan QR option to connect.  
4\. Accept on the wallet the connection request | 1\. The app has been correctly set-up  
2\. A modal with wallet options is opened  
3\. A QR code is shown on the website and the wallet is able to scan it.  
4\. The connection is successfully established. The wallet data is now shown on the website. |
| **Connect to dapp via mobile browser (Deep-link)** | 1\. Open [https://appkit-lab.reown.com/](https://appkit-lab.reown.com/) in your mobile device.  
2\. Select one of the default options (e.g. Wagmi for EVM chains). Press the “Custom Wallet” button from the navbar. Fill in the wallet’s name and its deeplink (Mobile Link) in the “Add a Custom Wallet” form. Press “Add Wallet”. After the website reloads, press the “Connect Wallet” button and select the newly created wallet.  
3\. Accept the connection request in the wallet application. | 1\. N/A  
2\. A form should show up on the website to fill in the wallet’s data. After the changes are applied, the modal should show the newly created wallet on the main view.  
3\. The user should be redirected to the wallet application and a modal with a connection request should show up on the wallet application. The wallet should connect successfully. On Android devices, the user should be redirected back to the website after accepting the connection request. |
| **Switch chains - dapp side** | 1\. Once the wallet is connected, press on the modal button on the top right of the website.  
2\. Press the first button of the modal to switch the chain.  
3\. Select any available chain, close the modal, and press the “Send Transaction” button | 1\. A modal with the account information should pop up on the website.  
2\. A new view with supported chains should show up.  
3\. The transaction request that pops up on the wallet should show in their information the correct chain that was previously selected. |
| **Switch Chains - wallet side (if supported)** | 1\. Check if the wallet supports chain switching. If so, select a different chain from the connected one. | 1\. The chain change should be reflected on the website. The first card shows the current chain ID. |
| **Accounts Switching - wallet side** | 1\. In the wallet app, switch from one account to another. | 1\. The account switch event should be reflected in the modal’s account view on the website. |
| **Disconnect a wallet** | 1\. Select the “Disconnect” button from the Wallet App (Ideally, wallets should have a section where users can see all their existing dApp connections and manage/disconnect from dApps in one spot—this is not always true, so if not possible, just skip this).  
2\. Repeat the above steps and press the “Disconnect” button from the dApp (this should always be available). | 1\. The related session should disappear from the dApp and the Wallet App.  
2\. The related session should disappear from the dApp and the Wallet App. |
| **Verify API** | 1\. Open [https://malicious-app-verify-simulation.vercel.app/](https://malicious-app-verify-simulation.vercel.app/)  
2\. Select a supported chain by the wallet (some wallets don’t support testnets) and press the “Connect” button.  
3\. Scan with the wallet the generated QR code. | 1\. N/A  
2\. A modal should show up with a QR code to scan.  
3\. The connection request in the wallet should flag the website as malicious. |

### Chain Specific

The following test cases only apply for wallets supporting a particular set of chains.

Initialization
--------------

To create an instance of ReownWalletKit, you need to pass in the `core` and `metadata` parameters.

Session
-------

A session is a connection between a dapp and a wallet. It is established when a user approves a session proposal from a dapp. A session is active until the user disconnects from the dapp or the session expires.

### Namespace Builder

On flutter you don’t need to worry about Namespace Builder as Flutter SDK would handle that for you and generate a namespace object with the supported ones.

All you have to do is make sure you are registering

1.  **events emitters** with `_walletKit.registerEventEmitter()` for events you want to support on your wallet
2.  **request handlers** with `_walletKit.registerRequestHandler()` for methods you want to support on your wallet
3.  **wallet’s accounts** with `_walletKit.registerAccount()` for accounts you want these events and methods to be enabled on

for every **chain** you want to support.

When a dApp propose a session, with declared required and/or optional namespaces, your wallet will be able to approve an **already generated set of namespaces** based on your registered events, methods and accounts.

You can access this object in **SessionProposalEvent** during `onSessionProposal` event by querying `event.params.generatedNamespaces`. (See next section)

Flutter SDK provides a handy `MethodsConstants` and `EventsConstants` for already defined set of required and optional values.

### EVM methods & events

In @walletconnect/ethereum-provider, (our abstracted EVM SDK for apps) we support by default the following Ethereum methods and events:

### Session Approval

As mentioned before, the `SessionProposalEvent` is emitted when a dapp initiates a new session with your wallet. The event object will include the information about the dapp and requested namespaces. The wallet should display a prompt for the user to approve or reject the session.

To approve a session, call `approveSession()` and pass in the `event.id` and your approved namespaces.

*   If you decide to use the `registerRequestHandler()` method to register handlers for supported methods, as explained in previous section, you would use the `generatedNamespaces` object in the `approveSession`
*   If you decide to handle session requests by subscribing to the `onSessionRequest` event, you would need to pass your own set of approved namespaces.

Either way you decide you would subscribe to the `onSessionProposal` event and use `approveSession()` as follows:

#### Pairing

The `pair` method initiates a pairing process with a dapp using the given `uri` (QR code from the dapps). To learn more about pairing, checkout out the [docs](https://specs.walletconnect.com/2.0/specs/clients/core/pairing/).

Scan the QR code and parse the URI, and pair with the dapp.  
Upon the first pairing, you will immediately receive `onSessionProposal` and `onAuthRequest` events.

### Session Rejection

To reject the request, pass in an error code and reason according to [protocol specs](https://specs.walletconnect.com/2.0/specs/clients/sign/error-codes). See also [Formatted Errors](https://docs.reown.com/_sites/docs.reown.com/walletkit/flutter/usage#formatted-errors) section.

To reject a session:

### Responding to Session requests

To handle a session request, such as `personal_sign`, you have two ways and they are mutually exclusive, so, you use either one way or the other:

1.  Default one is to register a request handler for the methods and chains you want to support. So let’s say your wallet supports `eip155:1` and `eip155:137`. This would translate to:

Once you have your handlers registered, these are going to be triggered _INSTEAD OF_ the `onSessionRequest` event.

2.  The other way is subscribing to onSessionRequest events and handle the request based on the method that is firing the event

### Updating a Session

If you wish to include new accounts or chains or methods in an existing session, `updateSession` allows you to do so. You need pass in the `topic` and a new `Namespaces` object that contains all of the existing namespaces as well as the new data you wish to include.

After you update the session, the dapp connected to your wallet will receive a `SessionUpdate` event.

### Extending a Session

To extend the session, call the `extendSession` method and pass in the new `topic`. The `SessionUpdate` event will be emitted from the wallet.

### Session Disconnect

To initiate a session disconnect, call the `disconnectSession` method and pass in the `topic` and a `reason`.

When either the dapp or the wallet disconnects from a session, a `SessionDelete` event will be emitted. It’s important to subscribe to this event so you could keep your state up-to-date.

Using `disconnectSession()` alone will make the pairing topic persist, i.e, it can be re-used until it expires. If you want to disconnect (remove) the pairing topic as well you would have add another call as follows:

#### Supporting session events

In order to support session events, such as `chainChanged` or `accountChanged`, you would have to to register an event emitter for such events, for every chain you want to emit an event for (similar to request handlers).

And to emit an event, call `emitSessionEvent()` as follows:

For a better understanding please check out the [example wallet](https://github.com/reown-com/reown_flutter/tree/master/packages/reown_walletkit/example/lib) and, in particular, the [EVMService](https://github.com/reown-com/reown_flutter/blob/master/packages/reown_walletkit/example/lib/dependencies/chain_services/evm_service.dart) inside of it.

### Formatted Errors

Our SDK exports a variety of ready-made error objects for you to use in the different situations. Most commonly used are…

  <title>Verify - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/flutter/cloud/verify</url>
  <content>Verify API is a security-focused feature that allows wallets to notify end-users when they may be connecting to a suspicious or malicious domain, helping to prevent phishing attacks across the industry.

Once a wallet knows whether an end-user is on uniswap.com or eviluniswap.com, it can help them to detect potentially harmful connections through Verify’s combined offering of Reown’s domain registry.

Cloud Verification
------------------

In order to verify your app domain in Reown Cloud follow these steps:

1.  Head over to [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/)
    
2.  Create a new project or click on the project you would like to verify.
    
3.  On the settings tab, head over to the ‘Domain verification’ section and fill in the website URL that you wish to verify.
    

4.  Click on the copy button and head over to your domain Name Registrar/Provider to edit your DNS records. Alternatively, if you can’t manage DNS records for your project (eg: ENS or vercel.app) you can host a static file under `/.well-known/walletconnect.txt` which contains the entire verification code that you copied. If you are using the static file method, you can jump over step 7.
    
5.  Under `Type`, select `TXT`. In the “Answer” section, paste the text you copied from the cloud dashboard. This field may vary across DNS dashboards. If you’re trying to register a subdomain, add it under `Host`. Feel free to leave TTL at its default value.
    

6.  Depending on your DNS settings, this might take a while to reflect. You can check out DNS settings for your website with CLI tools like Dig or with websites like [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=txt)
    
7.  Once this is done and you have confirmed this change is reflected, head on back to your Cloud Dashboard and click on Verify.
    

8.  You should see a toast pop up in the bottom right section of your screen and the domain verification section should have a green tick next to it.</content>

  <title>Usage - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/web/usage</url>
  <content>This section provides instructions on how to initialize the WalletKit client, approve sessions with supported namespaces, and respond to session requests, enabling easy integration of Web3 wallets with dapps through a simple and intuitive interface.

Cloud Configuration
-------------------

Create a new project on Reown Cloud at [https://cloud.reown.com](https://cloud.reown.com/) and obtain a new project ID.

Initialization
--------------

Create a new instance from Core and initialize it with a projectId created from installation. Next, create WalletKit instance by calling init on walletKit. Passing in the options object containing metadata about the app and an optional relay URL.

Session
-------

A session is a connection between a dapp and a wallet. It is established when a user approves a session proposal from a dapp. A session is active until the user disconnects from the dapp or the session expires.

### Namespace Builder

With WalletKit (and @walletconnect/utils) we’ve published a helper utility that greatly reduces the complexity of parsing the `required` and `optional` namespaces. It accepts as parameters a `session proposal` along with your user’s `chains/methods/events/accounts` and returns ready-to-use `namespaces` object.

Example usage

If your wallet supports multiple namespaces e.g. `eip155`,`cosmos` & `near` Your `supportedNamespaces` should look like the following example.

### Get Active Sessions

You can get the wallet active sessions using the `getActiveSessions` function.

### EVM methods & events

In @walletconnect/ethereum-provider, (our abstracted EVM SDK for apps) we support by default the following Ethereum methods and events:

### Session Approval

The `session_proposal` event is emitted when a dapp initiates a new session with a user’s wallet. The event will include a `proposal` object with information about the dapp and requested permissions. The wallet should display a prompt for the user to approve or reject the session. If approved, call `approveSession` and pass in the `proposal.id` and requested `namespaces`.

The `pair` method initiates a WalletConnect pairing process with a dapp using the given `uri` (QR code from the dapps). To learn more about pairing, checkout out the [docs](https://docs.reown.com/advanced/api/core/pairing).

### 🛠️ Usage examples

*   [in a demo wallet app](https://github.com/WalletConnect/web-examples/blob/a50c8eb5a10666f25911713c5358e78f1ca576d6/advanced/wallets/react-wallet-v2/src/views/SessionProposalModal.tsx#L264)
*   [in integration tests](https://github.com/reown-com/reown-walletkit-js/blob/main/packages/walletkit/test/sign.spec.ts#L55)

### ⚠️ Expected Errors

*   `No matching key. proposal id doesn't exist: 1`

This rejection means the SDK can’t find a record with the given `proposal.id` - in this example `1`. This can happen when the proposal has expired (by default 5 minutes) or if you attempt to respond to a proposal that has already been approved/rejected. If you are seeing this error, please make sure that you are calling `approveSession` with the correct `proposal.id` that is available within the proposal payload.

*   `Error: Missing or invalid. approve(), namespaces should be an object with data`

This error means that the `namespaces` parameter passed to `approveSession` is either missing or invalid. Please check that you are passing a valid `namespaces` object that satisfies all required properties.

*   `Non conforming namespaces. approve() namespaces <property> don't satisfy required namespaces.`

This error indicates that some value(s) in your `namespaces` object do not satisfy the required namespaces requested by the dapp. To provide additional guidance, the message might include info about the exact property that is missing or invalid e.g. `Required: eip155:1 Approved: eip155:137`. Please check [CAIP-25](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-25.md) to familiarize yourself with the standard and it’s nuances. Additionally, we highly recommend you to use our `namespace` builder utility that would greatly simplify the process of parsing & building a valid `namespaces` object.

### Session Rejection

In the event you want to reject the session proposal, call the `rejectSession` method. The `getSDKError` function comes from the `@walletconnect/utils` [library](https://github.com/WalletConnect/walletconnect-monorepo/tree/v2.0/packages/utils).

### 🛠️ Usage examples

*   [in a demo wallet app](https://github.com/WalletConnect/web-examples/blob/a50c8eb5a10666f25911713c5358e78f1ca576d6/advanced/wallets/react-wallet-v2/src/views/SessionProposalModal.tsx#L287)
*   [in integration tests](https://github.com/reown-com/reown-walletkit-js/blob/main/packages/walletkit/test/sign.spec.ts#L79)

### ⚠️ Expected Errors

*   `No matching key. proposal id doesn't exist: 1`

This rejection means the SDK can’t find a record with the given `proposal.id` - in this example `1`. This can happen when the proposal has expired (by default 5 minutes) or if you attempt to respond to a proposal that has already been approved/rejected. If you are seeing this error, please make sure that you are calling `rejectSession` with the correct `proposal.id` that is available within the proposal payload.

*   `Error: Missing or invalid. reject() reason:`

This rejection means the `reason` parameter passed to `rejectSession` is either missing or invalid. We recommend using the `getSDKError` function from the `@walletconnect/utils` library that will populate & format the parameter for you.

### Responding to Session requests

The `session_request` event is emitted when the SDK received a request from the peer and it needs the wallet to perform a specific action, such as signing a transaction. The event contains a `topic` and a `request` object, which will vary depending on the action requested.

To respond to the request, you can access the `topic` and `request` object by destructuring them from the event payload. To see a list of possible `request` and `response` objects, refer to the relevant JSON-RPC Methods for [Ethereum](https://docs.reown.com/advanced/multichain/rpc-reference/ethereum-rpc.md), [Solana](https://docs.reown.com/advanced/multichain/rpc-reference/solana-rpc.md), [Cosmos](https://docs.reown.com/advanced/multichain/rpc-reference/cosmos-rpc.md), or [Stellar](https://docs.reown.com/advanced/multichain/rpc-reference/stellar-rpc.md).

As an example, if the dapp requests a `personal_sign` method, you can extract the `params` array from the `request` object. The first item in the array is the hex version of the message to be signed, which can be converted to UTF-8 and assigned to a `message` variable. The second item in `params` is the user’s wallet address.

To sign the message, you can use your wallet’s `signMessage` method and pass in the message. The signed message, along with the `id` from the event payload, can then be used to create a `response` object, which can be passed into `respondSessionRequest`.

To reject a session request, the response should be similar to this.

### 🛠️ Usage examples

*   [in a demo wallet app](https://github.com/WalletConnect/web-examples/blob/a50c8eb5a10666f25911713c5358e78f1ca576d6/advanced/wallets/react-wallet-v2/src/views/SessionSignModal.tsx#L36)
*   [in integration tests](https://github.com/reown-com/reown-walletkit-js/blob/main/packages/walletkit/test/sign.spec.ts#L165)

### ⚠️ Expected Errors

*   `Error: No matching key. session topic doesn't exist: 'xyz...'`

This rejection means the SDK can’t find a session with the given `topic` - in this example `xyz...`. This can happen when the session has been disconnected by either the wallet or the dapp while the session request was being processed or if a session with such topic doesn’t exist. If you are seeing this error, please make sure that you are using a correct topic that is available within the request payload.

*   `Error: Missing or invalid. respond() response:`

This rejection means the `response` parameter passed to `respondSessionRequest` is either missing or invalid. The response should be a valid [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) response object. We recommend you to use our `formatJsonRpcResult` utility from `"@walletconnect/jsonrpc-utils"` that will format the response for you.

Example usage: `id` argument being the request id from the request payload.

### Updating a Session

If you wish to include new accounts or chains or methods in an existing session, `updateSession` allows you to do so. You need pass in the `topic` and a new `Namespaces` object that contains all of the existing namespaces as well as the new data you wish to include. After you update the session, the other peer will receive a `session_update` event.

An example adding a new account to an existing session:

### 🛠️ Usage examples

*   [in a demo wallet app](https://github.com/WalletConnect/web-examples/blob/a50c8eb5a10666f25911713c5358e78f1ca576d6/advanced/wallets/react-wallet-v2/src/pages/session.tsx#L77)
*   [in integration tests](https://github.com/reown-com/reown-walletkit-js/blob/main/packages/walletkit/test/sign.spec.ts#L98)

### ⚠️ Expected Errors

Note that all `namespaces` validation applies and you still have to satisfy the required namespaces requested by the dapp.

*   `Error: No matching key. session topic doesn't exist: 'xyz...'`

This rejection means the SDK can’t find a session with the given `topic` - in this example `xyz...`. This can happen when the session you’re trying to update has already been disconnected by either the wallet or the dapp or if a session with such topic doesn’t exist. If you are seeing this error, please make sure that you are using a correct topic of an active session.

*   `Error: Missing or invalid. update(), namespaces should be an object with data`

This error means that the `namespaces` parameter passed to `updateSession` is either missing or invalid. Please check that you are passing a valid `namespaces` object that satisfies all required properties.

*   `Non conforming namespaces. update() namespaces <property> don't satisfy required namespaces.`

This error indicates that some value(s) in your `namespaces` object do not satisfy the required namespaces requested by the dapp. To provide additional guidance, the message might include info about the exact property that is missing or invalid e.g. `Required: eip155:1 Approved: eip155:137`. Please check [CAIP-25](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-25.md) to familiarize yourself with the standard and it’s nuances. Additionally, we highly recommend you to use our `namespace` builder utility that would greatly simplify the process of parsing & building a valid `namespaces` object.

### Extending a Session

Sessions have a default expiry of 7 days. To extend a session by an additional 7 days, call `.extendSession` method and pass in the `topic` of the session you wish to extend.

### 🛠️ Usage examples

*   [in integration tests](https://github.com/reown-com/reown-walletkit-js/blob/main/packages/walletkit/test/sign.spec.ts#L130)

### ⚠️ Expected Errors

*   `Error: No matching key. session topic doesn't exist: 'xyz...'`

This rejection means the SDK can’t find a session with the given `topic` - in this example `xyz...`. This can happen when the session you’re trying to update has already been disconnected by either the wallet or the dapp or if a session with such topic doesn’t exist. If you are seeing this error, please make sure that you are using a correct topic of an active session.

### Session Disconnect

To initiate disconnect from a session(think session delete), call `.disconnectSession` by passing a `topic` & `reason` for the disconnect. The other peer will receive a `session_delete` and be notified that the session has been disconnected.

### 🛠️ Usage examples

*   [in integration tests](https://github.com/reown-com/reown-walletkit-js/blob/main/packages/walletkit/test/sign.spec.ts#L222)

### ⚠️ Expected Errors

*   `Error: No matching key. session topic doesn't exist: 'xyz...'`

This rejection means the SDK can’t find a session with the given `topic` - in this example `xyz...`. This can happen when the session you’re trying to update has already been disconnected by either the wallet or the dapp or if a session with such topic doesn’t exist. If you are seeing this error, please make sure that you are using a correct topic of an active session.

### Emitting Session Events

To emit session events, call the `emitSessionEvent` and pass in the params. If you wish to switch to chain/account that is not approved (missing from `session.namespaces`) you will have to update the session first. In the following example, the wallet will emit `session_event` that will instruct the dapp to switch the active accounts.

In the following example, the wallet will emit `session_event` when the wallet switches chains.</content>

  <title>Wallet Call API - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/web/eip5792</url>
  <content>WalletConnect supports [EIP-5792](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5792#atomicbatch-capability), which defines new JSON-RPC methods that enable apps to ask a wallet to process a batch of onchain write calls and to check on the status of those calls. Applications can specify that these onchain calls be executed taking advantage of specific capabilities previously expressed by the wallet; an additional, a novel wallet RPC is defined to enable apps to query the wallet for those capabilities.

*   `wallet_sendCalls`: Requests that a wallet submits a batch of calls.
*   `wallet_getCallsStatus`: Returns the status of a call batch that was sent via wallet\_sendCalls.
*   `wallet_showCallsStatus`: Requests that a wallet shows information about a given call bundle that was sent with wallet\_sendCalls.
*   `wallet_getCapabilities`: This RPC allows an application to request capabilities from a wallet (e.g. batch transactions, paymaster communication).</content>

  <title>Best Practices - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/web/best-practices</url>
  <content>The purpose of this guide is to show the best practices in regards of the WalletKit client usage. The goal is to provide the best user experience that just works in every circumstances.

Pairing
-------

A pairing is a connection between a wallet and a dapp that has fixed permissions to only allow a dapp to propose a session through it. Dapp can propose infinite number of sessions on one pairing. Wallet must use a pair method from WalletKit client to pair with dapp.

### Pairing Expiry

A pairing expiry event is triggered whenever a pairing is expired. The expiry for inactive pairing is 5 mins, whereas for active pairing is 30 days. A pairing becomes active when a session proposal is received and user successfully approves it. This event helps to know when given pairing expires and update UI accordingly.

### Expected User flow

### Pairing Flow

### Pairing Error

### Expected Errors

While pairing the following errors might occur:

*   No Internet connection error or pairing timeout when scanning QR with no Internet connection
    *   User should pair again with Internet connection
*   Pairing expired error when scanning a QR code with expired pairing
    *   User should refresh a QR code and scan again
*   Pairing with existing pairing is not allowed
    *   User should refresh a QR code and scan again. I usually happens when user scans an already paired QR code.

Session Proposal
----------------

A session proposal is a handshake sent by a dapp and it’s purpose is to define a session rules. Whenever a user wants to establish a connection between a wallet and a dapp, one should approve a session proposal.

### User Action Feedback

Whenever user approves or rejects a session proposal, wallet should show loading indicators in a moment of the button press until Relay acknowledgement is received for any of this actions.

Approving session

Rejecting session

### Session Proposal Expiry

A session proposal expiry is 5 mins. It means a given proposal is stored for 5 mins in the SDK storage and user has 5 mins for approval or rejection decision. After that time the below event is emitted and proposal modal should be removed from the app’s UI.

### Expected User flow

### Approve or Reject Session Proposal

### Error Handling

### Expected Errors

While approving or rejecting a session proposal the following errors might occurs:

*   No Internet connection
    *   It happens when a user tries to approve or reject session proposal with no Internet connection
*   Session proposal expired
    *   It happens when users tries to approve or reject expired session proposal
*   Invalid namespaces
    *   It happens when a validation of session namespaces fails
*   Timeout
    *   It happens when Relay doesn’t acknowledge session settle publish within 10s

Session Request
---------------

A session request represents the request sent by a dapp to a wallet.

### User Action Feedback

Whenever user approves or rejects a session request, wallet should show loading indicators in a moment of the button press until Relay acknowledgement is received for any of this actions.

### Session Request Expiry

A session request expiry is defined by a dapp. It’s value must be between now() + 5mins and now() + 7 days. After the session request expires the below event is emitted and session request modal should be removed from the app’s UI.

### Expected User flow

### Approve or Reject Session Proposal

### Error Handling

### Expected Errors

While approving or rejecting a session request the following error might occur:

*   Invalid session
    *   This error might happen when user approves or rejects a session request on expired session
*   Session request expired
    *   This error might happen when user approves or rejects a session request that already expires
*   Timeout
    *   It happens when Relay doesn’t acknowledge session settle publish within 10s

Web Socket Connection State
---------------------------

The Web Socket connection state tracks the connection with the relay server, event is emitted whenever a connection state changes.

### Expected User flow

How do we test wallets?
-----------------------

In order to offer a great user experience in our APIs and SDKs every Cloud submission goes through a QA process to make sure that the integration of the WalletConnect protocol is working correctly.

The following list details our QA flow and how to reproduce it:

| Test Case | Steps | Expected Results |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Set Up** | 1\. Download the wallet  
2\. Install the wallet app  
3\. Sign up for an account with the wallet app  
4\. Create one or more accounts | 1\. N/A  
2\. The app is installed  
3\. I have an account  
4\. I have one or more accounts |
| **Connect to dapp via web browser** | 1\. Open the Reown connection page [https://appkit-lab.reown.com/](https://appkit-lab.reown.com/) from a PC  
2\. Press on the “Connect Wallet” button and select the Reown option.  
3\. Open the wallet app and use the scan QR option to connect.  
4\. Accept on the wallet the connection request | 1\. The app has been correctly set-up  
2\. A modal with wallet options is opened  
3\. A QR code is shown on the website and the wallet is able to scan it.  
4\. The connection is successfully established. The wallet data is now shown on the website. |
| **Connect to dapp via mobile browser (Deep-link)** | 1\. Open [https://appkit-lab.reown.com/](https://appkit-lab.reown.com/) in your mobile device.  
2\. Select one of the default options (e.g. Wagmi for EVM chains). Press the “Custom Wallet” button from the navbar. Fill in the wallet’s name and its deeplink (Mobile Link) in the “Add a Custom Wallet” form. Press “Add Wallet”. After the website reloads, press the “Connect Wallet” button and select the newly created wallet.  
3\. Accept the connection request in the wallet application. | 1\. N/A  
2\. A form should show up on the website to fill in the wallet’s data. After the changes are applied, the modal should show the newly created wallet on the main view.  
3\. The user should be redirected to the wallet application and a modal with a connection request should show up on the wallet application. The wallet should connect successfully. On Android devices, the user should be redirected back to the website after accepting the connection request. |
| **Switch chains - dapp side** | 1\. Once the wallet is connected, press on the modal button on the top right of the website.  
2\. Press the first button of the modal to switch the chain.  
3\. Select any available chain, close the modal, and press the “Send Transaction” button | 1\. A modal with the account information should pop up on the website.  
2\. A new view with supported chains should show up.  
3\. The transaction request that pops up on the wallet should show in their information the correct chain that was previously selected. |
| **Switch Chains - wallet side (if supported)** | 1\. Check if the wallet supports chain switching. If so, select a different chain from the connected one. | 1\. The chain change should be reflected on the website. The first card shows the current chain ID. |
| **Accounts Switching - wallet side** | 1\. In the wallet app, switch from one account to another. | 1\. The account switch event should be reflected in the modal’s account view on the website. |
| **Disconnect a wallet** | 1\. Select the “Disconnect” button from the Wallet App (Ideally, wallets should have a section where users can see all their existing dApp connections and manage/disconnect from dApps in one spot—this is not always true, so if not possible, just skip this).  
2\. Repeat the above steps and press the “Disconnect” button from the dApp (this should always be available). | 1\. The related session should disappear from the dApp and the Wallet App.  
2\. The related session should disappear from the dApp and the Wallet App. |
| **Verify API** | 1\. Open [https://malicious-app-verify-simulation.vercel.app/](https://malicious-app-verify-simulation.vercel.app/)  
2\. Select a supported chain by the wallet (some wallets don’t support testnets) and press the “Connect” button.  
3\. Scan with the wallet the generated QR code. | 1\. N/A  
2\. A modal should show up with a QR code to scan.  
3\. The connection request in the wallet should flag the website as malicious. |

### Chain Specific

The following test cases only apply for wallets supporting a particular set of chains.

| Test Case | Steps | Expected Results |
| --- | --- | --- |

2\. Press the “Sign Typed Data” button.  
3\. Accept the signature request on the wallet. | 1\. N/A  
2\. A modal should pop up on the wallet app requesting a signature.  
3\. Once accepted and signed, the hash should show up on the website. |
| **Supporting eth\_sendTransaction** | 1\. Connect the wallet.  
2\. Press the “Send Transaction” button. | 1\. N/A  
2\. A modal should pop up on the wallet app requesting a signature. |

What’s Next?
------------

Now depending on whether or not your submission met all parameters, you will receive an email from the Reown team with the status of your submission. This change will also be reflected with more directions in the “Explorer” tab of your project. If your submission was not accepted, you can make the necessary changes and resubmit your project for review. The reason for rejection will be mentioned in the email and in the “Explorer” tab of your project.

In case of any questions, feel free to ask on [Github Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/WalletConnect/discussions/categories/explorer-support)</content>

  <title>Verify - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/web/cloud/verify</url>
  <content>Verify API is a security-focused feature that allows wallets to notify end-users when they may be connecting to a suspicious or malicious domain, helping to prevent phishing attacks across the industry.

Once a wallet knows whether an end-user is on uniswap.com or eviluniswap.com, it can help them to detect potentially harmful connections through Verify’s combined offering of Reown’s domain registry.

Cloud Verification
------------------

In order to verify your app domain in Reown Cloud follow these steps:

1.  Head over to [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/)
    
2.  Create a new project or click on the project you would like to verify.
    
3.  On the settings tab, head over to the ‘Domain verification’ section and fill in the website URL that you wish to verify.
    

4.  Click on the copy button and head over to your domain Name Registrar/Provider to edit your DNS records. Alternatively, if you can’t manage DNS records for your project (eg: ENS or vercel.app) you can host a static file under `/.well-known/walletconnect.txt` which contains the entire verification code that you copied. If you are using the static file method, you can jump over step 7.
    
5.  Under `Type`, select `TXT`. In the “Answer” section, paste the text you copied from the cloud dashboard. This field may vary across DNS dashboards. If you’re trying to register a subdomain, add it under `Host`. Feel free to leave TTL at its default value.
    

6.  Depending on your DNS settings, this might take a while to reflect. You can check out DNS settings for your website with CLI tools like Dig or with websites like [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=txt)
    
7.  Once this is done and you have confirmed this change is reflected, head on back to your Cloud Dashboard and click on Verify.
    

8.  You should see a toast pop up in the bottom right section of your screen and the domain verification section should have a green tick next to it.</content>

  <title>Relay - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/web/cloud/relay</url>
  <content>Project ID
----------

The Project ID is consumed through URL parameters.

URL parameters used:

*   `projectId`: Your Project ID can be obtained from [cloud.reown.com](https://cloud.reown.com/)

Example URL:

`https://relay.walletconnect.com/?projectId=c4f79cc821944d9680842e34466bfbd`

This can be instantiated from the client with the `projectId` in the `SignClient` constructor.

Allowlist
---------

To help prevent malicious use of your project ID you are strongly encouraged to set an allowlist of [origins](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin) or application/bundle ids for mobile applications where the project ID is used. Requests from other origins will be denied.

*   Allowlist supports a list of origins in the format `[scheme://]<hostname[:port]`.
*   [Application ID](https://developer.android.com/build/configure-app-module#set-application-id)/[Bundle IDs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/bundle_ids) typically are defined using the [reverse domain name notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation)

Using `localhost` (or `127.0.0.1`) is always permitted, and if empty all origins are allowed. Updates take 15 minutes to apply.

If scheme or port is specified, it must match exactly. Hostname must also match exactly, but wildcards can be used for individual labels within the hostname.

Example of possible origins in the allowlist:

*   `example.com` - allows `https://example.com` or `http://example.com` but not `https://www.example.com`
*   `https://example.com` - allows `https://example.com` but not `http://example.com`
*   `https://www.example.com` - allows `https://www.example.com` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://example.com:8080` - allows `https://example.com:8080` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://*.example.com` - allows `https://www.example.com` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://*.*.example.com` - allows `https://www.subdomain.example.com` but not `https://www.example.com` or `https://example.com`
*   `https://www.*.example.com` - allows `https://www.subdomain.example.com` but not `https://www.example.com`
*   `https://www-*.example.com` - invalid; `*` must be the full label

Error Codes
-----------

| Reason | Error Code |
| --- | --- |
| Project ID doesn’t exist OR JWT is expired | 401 |
| Exists and is invalid | 403 |
| Too many requests | 1013 |

Websocket Close Codes
---------------------

| Code | Description | Reconnect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1001 | Server terminating | Yes |
| 4008 | Client stale: connected without a prior subscription and is not sending data | When needed |
| 4010 | Load Rebalancing | Yes |

Best Practices
--------------

*   Create a new `projectId` for each project. This allows for more granular control, dedicated explorer listings, and project metrics.
*   Don’t reuse a `projectId`.
*   Use the AllowList to limit unauthorized usage.
*   Avoid committing projects keys to the repo. Use env variables instead.

*   [Project ID](#project-id)

How do we test wallets?
-----------------------

In order to offer a great user experience in our APIs and SDKs every Cloud submission goes through a QA process to make sure that the integration of the WalletConnect protocol is working correctly.

The following list details our QA flow and how to reproduce it:

| Test Case | Steps | Expected Results |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Set Up** | 1\. Download the wallet  
2\. Install the wallet app  
3\. Sign up for an account with the wallet app  
4\. Create one or more accounts | 1\. N/A  
2\. The app is installed  
3\. I have an account  
4\. I have one or more accounts |
| **Connect to dapp via web browser** | 1\. Open the Reown connection page [https://appkit-lab.reown.com/](https://appkit-lab.reown.com/) from a PC  
2\. Press on the “Connect Wallet” button and select the Reown option.  
3\. Open the wallet app and use the scan QR option to connect.  
4\. Accept on the wallet the connection request | 1\. The app has been correctly set-up  
2\. A modal with wallet options is opened  
3\. A QR code is shown on the website and the wallet is able to scan it.  
4\. The connection is successfully established. The wallet data is now shown on the website. |
| **Connect to dapp via mobile browser (Deep-link)** | 1\. Open [https://appkit-lab.reown.com/](https://appkit-lab.reown.com/) in your mobile device.  
2\. Select one of the default options (e.g. Wagmi for EVM chains). Press the “Custom Wallet” button from the navbar. Fill in the wallet’s name and its deeplink (Mobile Link) in the “Add a Custom Wallet” form. Press “Add Wallet”. After the website reloads, press the “Connect Wallet” button and select the newly created wallet.  
3\. Accept the connection request in the wallet application. | 1\. N/A  
2\. A form should show up on the website to fill in the wallet’s data. After the changes are applied, the modal should show the newly created wallet on the main view.  
3\. The user should be redirected to the wallet application and a modal with a connection request should show up on the wallet application. The wallet should connect successfully. On Android devices, the user should be redirected back to the website after accepting the connection request. |
| **Switch chains - dapp side** | 1\. Once the wallet is connected, press on the modal button on the top right of the website.  
2\. Press the first button of the modal to switch the chain.  
3\. Select any available chain, close the modal, and press the “Send Transaction” button | 1\. A modal with the account information should pop up on the website.  
2\. A new view with supported chains should show up.  
3\. The transaction request that pops up on the wallet should show in their information the correct chain that was previously selected. |
| **Switch Chains - wallet side (if supported)** | 1\. Check if the wallet supports chain switching. If so, select a different chain from the connected one. | 1\. The chain change should be reflected on the website. The first card shows the current chain ID. |
| **Accounts Switching - wallet side** | 1\. In the wallet app, switch from one account to another. | 1\. The account switch event should be reflected in the modal’s account view on the website. |
| **Disconnect a wallet** | 1\. Select the “Disconnect” button from the Wallet App (Ideally, wallets should have a section where users can see all their existing dApp connections and manage/disconnect from dApps in one spot—this is not always true, so if not possible, just skip this).  
2\. Repeat the above steps and press the “Disconnect” button from the dApp (this should always be available). | 1\. The related session should disappear from the dApp and the Wallet App.  
2\. The related session should disappear from the dApp and the Wallet App. |
| **Verify API** | 1\. Open [https://malicious-app-verify-simulation.vercel.app/](https://malicious-app-verify-simulation.vercel.app/)  
2\. Select a supported chain by the wallet (some wallets don’t support testnets) and press the “Connect” button.  
3\. Scan with the wallet the generated QR code. | 1\. N/A  
2\. A modal should show up with a QR code to scan.  
3\. The connection request in the wallet should flag the website as malicious. |

  <title>Usage - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/c-sharp/usage</url>
  <content>This section provides instructions on how to initialize the WalletKit client, approve sessions with supported namespaces, and respond to session requests, enabling easy integration of Web3 wallets with dapps through a simple and intuitive interface.

Initialization
--------------

First you must setup a `Core` instance with a specific `Name` and `ProjectId`. You may optionally specify other `CoreOption` values, such as `RelayUrl` and `Storage`

Next, you must define a `Metadata` object which describes your Wallet. This includes a `Name`, `Description`, `Url` and `Icons` url.

Once you have both the `Core` and `Metadata` objects, you can initialize the `WalletKitClient`

Session
-------

A session is a connection between a dapp and a wallet. It is established when a user approves a session proposal from a dapp. A session is active until the user disconnects from the dapp or the session expires.

### Namespace Builder

To build a namespace mapping for either proposing a session **OR** approving a session, you can use .NET dictionary + class constructors directly, or use the built-in builder methods

### C# Constructor Style

### Builder Style

The `Namespaces` mapping is required when approving a proposed session from a dApp. Because of this, you may also construct a `Namespaces` from a `RequiredNamespaces`, which auto-populates all `Methods`, `Events` and `Chains` from the given `RequiredNamespaces`. This is provided for convenience.

### RequiredNamespaces

The `RequiredNamespaces` is required when setting up a session between a dApp and Wallet. The dApp will provide a `RequiredNamespaces` when proposing the session. The `RequiredNamespaces` and `ProposedNamespace` use the same style constructors + builder functions as `Namespaces` and `Namespace`.

### EVM methods & events

In @walletconnect/ethereum-provider, (our abstracted EVM SDK for apps) we support by default the following Ethereum methods and events:

### Session Approval

Wallets can pair an incoming session using the session’s Uri. Pairing a session lets the Wallet obtain the connection proposal which can then be approved or denied.

The wallet can then approve the proposal by constructing an approved `Namespaces`. The approved `Namespaces` should include the `RequiredNamespaces` under `proposal.RequiredNamespaces`, and may optionally include any optional namespaces specified under `proposal.OptionalNamespaces`

You may also just provide the addresses that will connect, and the SDK will create this approved `Namespaces` for you. This function **will not approve optional namespaces**

or

### Session Rejection

The wallet can reject the proposal using the following:

### Responding to Session requests

Responding to session requests is very similar to sending session requests. See dApp usage on how sending session requests works. All custom session requests requires a request class **and** response class to be created that matches the `params` field type in the custom session request. C# is a static typed language, so these types must be given whenever you do a session request (or do any querying for session requests).

Currently, **WalletKit does not automatically assume the object type for `params` is an array**. This is very important, since most EVM RPC requests have `params` as an array type. **Use `List<T>` to workaround this**. For example, for `eth_sendTransaction`, use `List<Transaction>` instead of `Transaction`.

Newtonsoft.Json is used for JSON serialization/deserialization, therefore you can use Newtonsoft.Json attributes when defining fields in your request/response classes.

### Building a Response type

Create a class for the response and populate it with the JSON properties the response object has. For this example, we will use `eth_getTransactionReceipt`

The `params` field for `eth_getTransactionReceipt` has the object type

The `RpcMethod` class attributes defines the rpc method this response uses, this is optional. The `RpcResponseOptions` class attributes define the expiry time and tag attached to the response, **this is required**.

### Sending a response

To respond to requests from a dApp, you must define the class representing the request object type. The request type for `eth_getTransactionReceipt` is the following:

We can handle the `eth_getTransactionReceipt` session request by doing the following:

The callback function gets invoked whenever the wallet receives the `eth_getTransactionReceipt` request from a connected dApp. You may optionally filter further which requests are handled using the `FilterRequests` function

The callback returns a `Task`, so the callback can be made async. To return a response, **you must** set the `Response` field in `RequestEventArgs<T, TR>` with the desired response.

### Updating a Session

Update a session, adding/removing additional namespaces in the given topic.

### Extending a Session

Extend a session’s expiry time so the session remains open

### Session Disconnect

To disconnect a session, use the `Disconnect` function. You may optional provide a reason for the disconnect.

Disconnecting requires the `topic` of the session to be given. This can be found in the `SessionStruct` object given when a session has been given approval by the Wallet.</content>

  <title>Verify - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/c-sharp/cloud/verify</url>
  <content>Verify API is a security-focused feature that allows wallets to notify end-users when they may be connecting to a suspicious or malicious domain, helping to prevent phishing attacks across the industry.

Once a wallet knows whether an end-user is on uniswap.com or eviluniswap.com, it can help them to detect potentially harmful connections through Verify’s combined offering of Reown’s domain registry.

Cloud Verification
------------------

In order to verify your app domain in Reown Cloud follow these steps:

1.  Head over to [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/)
    
2.  Create a new project or click on the project you would like to verify.
    
3.  On the settings tab, head over to the ‘Domain verification’ section and fill in the website URL that you wish to verify.
    

4.  Click on the copy button and head over to your domain Name Registrar/Provider to edit your DNS records. Alternatively, if you can’t manage DNS records for your project (eg: ENS or vercel.app) you can host a static file under `/.well-known/walletconnect.txt` which contains the entire verification code that you copied. If you are using the static file method, you can jump over step 7.
    
5.  Under `Type`, select `TXT`. In the “Answer” section, paste the text you copied from the cloud dashboard. This field may vary across DNS dashboards. If you’re trying to register a subdomain, add it under `Host`. Feel free to leave TTL at its default value.
    

6.  Depending on your DNS settings, this might take a while to reflect. You can check out DNS settings for your website with CLI tools like Dig or with websites like [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=txt)
    
7.  Once this is done and you have confirmed this change is reflected, head on back to your Cloud Dashboard and click on Verify.
    

8.  You should see a toast pop up in the bottom right section of your screen and the domain verification section should have a green tick next to it.</content>

  <title>Relay - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/c-sharp/cloud/relay</url>
  <content>Project ID
----------

The Project ID is consumed through URL parameters.

URL parameters used:

*   `projectId`: Your Project ID can be obtained from [cloud.reown.com](https://cloud.reown.com/)

Example URL:

`https://relay.walletconnect.com/?projectId=c4f79cc821944d9680842e34466bfbd`

This can be instantiated from the client with the `projectId` in the `SignClient` constructor.

Allowlist
---------

To help prevent malicious use of your project ID you are strongly encouraged to set an allowlist of [origins](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin) or application/bundle ids for mobile applications where the project ID is used. Requests from other origins will be denied.

*   Allowlist supports a list of origins in the format `[scheme://]<hostname[:port]`.
*   [Application ID](https://developer.android.com/build/configure-app-module#set-application-id)/[Bundle IDs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/bundle_ids) typically are defined using the [reverse domain name notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation)

Using `localhost` (or `127.0.0.1`) is always permitted, and if empty all origins are allowed. Updates take 15 minutes to apply.

If scheme or port is specified, it must match exactly. Hostname must also match exactly, but wildcards can be used for individual labels within the hostname.

Example of possible origins in the allowlist:

*   `example.com` - allows `https://example.com` or `http://example.com` but not `https://www.example.com`
*   `https://example.com` - allows `https://example.com` but not `http://example.com`
*   `https://www.example.com` - allows `https://www.example.com` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://example.com:8080` - allows `https://example.com:8080` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://*.example.com` - allows `https://www.example.com` but not `https://example.com`
*   `https://*.*.example.com` - allows `https://www.subdomain.example.com` but not `https://www.example.com` or `https://example.com`
*   `https://www.*.example.com` - allows `https://www.subdomain.example.com` but not `https://www.example.com`
*   `https://www-*.example.com` - invalid; `*` must be the full label

Error Codes
-----------

| Reason | Error Code |
| --- | --- |
| Project ID doesn’t exist OR JWT is expired | 401 |
| Exists and is invalid | 403 |
| Too many requests | 1013 |

Websocket Close Codes
---------------------

| Code | Description | Reconnect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1001 | Server terminating | Yes |
| 4008 | Client stale: connected without a prior subscription and is not sending data | When needed |
| 4010 | Load Rebalancing | Yes |

Best Practices
--------------

*   Create a new `projectId` for each project. This allows for more granular control, dedicated explorer listings, and project metrics.
*   Don’t reuse a `projectId`.
*   Use the AllowList to limit unauthorized usage.
*   Avoid committing projects keys to the repo. Use env variables instead.

*   [Project ID](#project-id)
*   [Allowlist](#allowlist)
*   [Error Codes](#error-codes)

  <title>Migrate from Web3Modal v5 to Reown AppKit Solana - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/upgrade/to-reown-appkit-ethers5-web</url>
  <content>Upgrade Guide
-------------

This guide will help you migrate from Web3Modal v5 using Ethers v5 to the latest Reown AppKit.

**Find here all the upgrades guides:**

*   [To Reown Web AppKit using Wagmi](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/upgrade/to-reown-appkit-web).
*   [To Reown Web AppKit using Solana](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/upgrade/to-reown-appkit-solana-web).
*   [To Reown Web AppKit using Ethers](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/upgrade/to-reown-appkit-ethers-web).

### Installation

To upgrade from Web3Modal v5 to Reown AppKit, start by removing the Web3Modal v5 dependency `@web3modal/ethers5`.

Next, install the Reown AppKit packages.

### Implementation

You can start the AppKit configuration by using either the **default** or **advanced** mode.

Default mode will implement WalletConnect, Browser Wallets (injected) and Coinbase options in addition to [WalletConnect’s provider](https://docs.reown.com/cloud/blockchain-api).

Start by importing `createAppKit` from `@reown/appkit` and the necessary chains from `@reown/appkit/networks`

Then, remove the `defaultConfig` function that is being imported from the Ethers package in your code.

Finally, set up the `Ethers5Adapter` and pass the other parameters to `createAppKit` function.

### Trigger the modal

Learn more about Reown AppKit [here](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/core/installation)

### Properties

As you may have noticed, some of the properties of Web3Modal have changed as a consequence of the migration to Reown AppKit.

#### adapters

The `adapters` property is a new property that is an array of adapters that can be initialized.

#### networks

The `chains` property is now `networks` in Reown AppKit. You should import them from `@reown/appkit/networks` package instead of importing these networks from `viem` or other packages.

#### defaultNetwork

The `defaultChain` property is now `defaultNetwork` in Reown AppKit. This is a network object that specifies the default network for your Web3 app.

### Utility Functions

The following methods are still available with the same nomenclature as before:

#### modal.getAddress()

This returns the connected address.

#### modal.getError()

This returns the error values.

#### modal.getChainId()

Returns the active network’s `chainId`

#### modal.switchNetwork(network)

This switches the active network to the different network being passed.

#### modal.getIsConnected()

This returns if the selected network adapter is connected or not.

#### modal.getWalletProvider()

This returns the active connection provider.

#### modal.getWalletProviderType()

This returns the active connection provider type.

#### modal.subscribeProvider(callback)

This is a listener that detects changes to the AppKit state, such as `address`, `chainId`, `isConnected`, `provider`, and `providerType`.

*   `address` - It returns the connected wallet address. The value returned is the same as `modal.getAddress()`
*   `chainId` - It returns the active network’s `chainId` . The value returned is the same as `modal.getChainId()`
*   `isConnected` - It returns if the selected network adapter is connected. The value returned is the same as `modal.getIsConnected()`
*   `provider` - It returns the active connection provider. The value returned is the same as `modal.getWalletProvider()`
*   `providerType` - It returns the active connection provider type. The value returned is the same as `modal.getWalletProviderType()`

The following methods and listeners are exactly the same and do not have any specific details related to the multiple chains feature.

*   `modal.getState` - it returns the modal state
    *   `open` - it returns boolean that indicates if the modal is open or not
    *   `selectedNetworkId` - it returns active network’s id
*   `modal.subscribeState`
*   `modal.setThemeMode`
*   `modal.getThemeMode`
*   `modal.setThemeVariables`
*   `modal.getThemeVariables`
*   `modal.subscribeTheme`
*   `modal.getEvent`
*   `modal.subscribeEvents`</content>

  <content>personal\_sign
--------------

The sign method calculates an Ethereum specific signature with:`sign(keccak256("\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n" + len(message) + message)))`.

By adding a prefix to the message makes the calculated signature recognizable as an Ethereum specific signature. This prevents misuse where a malicious DApp can sign arbitrary data (e.g. transaction) and use the signature to impersonate the victim.

**Note** See ecRecover to verify the signature.

### Parameters

message, account

1.  `DATA`, N Bytes - message to sign.
2.  `DATA`, 20 Bytes - address.

### Returns

`DATA`: Signature

### Example

eth\_sign
---------

The sign method calculates an Ethereum specific signature with: `sign(keccak256("\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n" + len(message) + message)))`.

By adding a prefix to the message makes the calculated signature recognizable as an Ethereum specific signature. This prevents misuse where a malicious DApp can sign arbitrary data (e.g. transaction) and use the signature to impersonate the victim.

**Note** the address to sign with must be unlocked.

### Parameters

account, message

1.  `DATA`, 20 Bytes - address.
2.  `DATA`, N Bytes - message to sign.

### Returns

`DATA`: Signature

### Example

An example how to use solidity ecrecover to verify the signature calculated with `eth_sign` can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/bas-vk/d46d83da2b2b4721efb0907aecdb7ebd). The contract is deployed on the testnet Ropsten and Rinkeby.

eth\_signTypedData
------------------

Calculates an Ethereum-specific signature in the form of `keccak256("\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n" + len(message) + message))`

By adding a prefix to the message makes the calculated signature recognizable as an Ethereum specific signature. This prevents misuse where a malicious DApp can sign arbitrary data (e.g. transaction) and use the signature to impersonate the victim.

**Note** the address to sign with must be unlocked.

### Parameters

account, message

1.  `DATA`, 20 Bytes - address.
2.  `DATA`, N Bytes - message to sign containing type information, a domain separator, and data

### Example Parameters

### Returns

`DATA`: Signature

hedera\_signAndExecuteTransaction
---------------------------------

The `hedera_signAndExecuteTransaction` method is a generic method for executing a transaction on the Hedera network. A dApp can begin by constructing a transaction with one of the Hedera SDKs or by constructing the raw protobuf messages and may select one or more consensus nodes that are authorized to execute the transaction.

The dApp then constructs a list of valid transaction bytes that differ only in the node account id and serializes the list, for example by using the `toBytes()` method of an SDK. Finally, the dApp base64 encodes the resulting bytes. This final base64 encoded string of bytes is sent as a method param titled `transactionList` to the wallet.

Wallets and SDKs must take special care to deserialize the list of transactions and validate that each transaction in the list differs only in the node authorized to receive the transaction and does NOT differ in intent before submitting to an end user for approval and ultimately signing.

### Parameters

1.  `Object` - signAndExecuteTransaction parameters 1.1. `signerAccountId` : `String` - Hedera account id in the format `<network>:<shard>.<realm>.<num><-optional-checksum>` 1.2. `transactionList` : `String` - Base64 encoded string of TransactionList bytes

### Returns

1.  `Object` - Result of transaction submission to Hedera network 1.1. `nodeId` : `String` - The Hedera node the transaction was submitted to 1.2. `transactionHash` : `String` - The hash of the transaction 1.3. `transactionId` : `String` - Transaction ID, which includes the payer account id and the valid start timestamp

### Error

In certain conditions, the Hedera network will return a response that signifies a pre-processing validation error, for example, when the transaction has expired. In these cases, wallets will return an error with the following format:

1.  `Object` - Result of transaction submission to Hedera network 1.1. `code` : 9000 - The reserved WalletConnect error code for unknown errors or errors not related to the WalletConnect protocol 1.2. `message` : `String` - A human readable string describing the nature of the failure 1.3. `data` : `Number` - An integer representing the ResponseCodeEnum value returned from the Hedera Node, which indicates the reason for the failure

### Example

#### Request

#### Result

#### Error

hedera\_signTransaction
-----------------------

The `hedera_signTransaction` signs a `TransactionBody` and returns a `SignatureMap` to the caller.

### Parameters

1.  `Object` - signTransaction parameters 1.1 `signerAccountId` : `String` - Hedera account id in the format `<network>:<shard>.<realm>.<num><-optional-checksum>` 1.2 `transactionBody` : `String` - Base64 encoded string representation of TransactionBody

### Returns

1.  `Object` - SignatureMap of related signed TransactionBody 1.1 `signatureMap` : `String` - Base64 encoded string of SignatureMap

### Example

#### Request

#### Result

hedera\_executeTransaction
--------------------------

When a dApp only requires the services of the controller to act as a relay to the Hedera network for submitting an already signed transaction, it can use the `hedera_executeTransaction` method.

### Parameters

1.  `Object` - executeTransaction parameters 1.1 `transactionList` : `String` Base64 encoded TransactionList

### Returns

1.  `Object` - Result of transaction submission to the Hedera network 1.1. `nodeId` : `String` - The Hedera node the transaction was submitted to 1.1. `transactionHash` : `String` - The hash of the transaction 1.1. `transactionId` : `String` - Transaction ID, which includes the payer account id and the valid start timestamp

### Error

In certain conditions, the Hedera network with return a response that signifies a pre-processing validation error, for example, when the transaction has expired. In these cases, wallets will return an error with the following format:

1.  `Object` - Result of transaction submission to the Hedera network 1.1. `code` : 9000 - The reserved WalletConnect error code for unknown errors or errors not related to the WalletConnect protocol 1.1. `message` : `String` - A human readable string describing the nature of the failure 1.1. `data` : `Number` - An integer representing the ResponseCodeEnum value returned from the Hedera Node, which indicates the reason for the failure

### Example

#### Request

#### Result

#### Error

hedera\_signAndExecuteQuery
---------------------------

This method provides functionality to perform a query on a Hedera consensus node. Many Queries against consensus nodes have a transaction fee [Learn more about Queries](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/sdks-and-apis/sdks/queries).

Most requests that do not change network state can be performed against a [Mirror Node](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/core-concepts/mirror-nodes) and for many use cases calling a mirror node endpoint is the recommended approach.

### Parameters

1.  `Object` - signAndExecuteQuery parameters 1.1 `signerAccountId` : `String` - Hedera account id in the format `<network>:<shard>.<realm>.<num><-optional-checksum>` 1.2 `query` : `String` - base64 encoded Query

### Returns

1.  `Object` - Result of the Query submitted to a Hedera consensus node 1.1. `response` : `String` - Base64 encoding of the Hedera API response

hedera\_signMessage
-------------------

This method accepts a plain text string value as input. If approved by the user, the controller UTF-8 encodes this message prepended with “\\x19Hedera Signed Message:\\n” plus the length of the message and signs the resulting bytes in the same manner as HAPI transactions are signed. The resulting signature(s) are transmitted back to the user encoded in a SignatureMap structure. The pseudo code for computing the signature is as follows:

### Parameters

1.  `Object` - signMessage parameters 1.1 `signerAccountId` : `String` - Hedera account id in the format `<network>:<shard>.<realm>.<num><-optional-checksum>` 1.2 `message` : `String`

### Returns

1.  `Object` - signMessage result 1.1 `signatureMap` : `String` - Base64 encoded SignatureMap

### Example

#### Request

#### Result

hedera\_getNodeAddresses
------------------------

While constructing a transaction for transmission to a controller, a dApp needs to choose which Hedera Network node shall receive the transaction prior to signing (this is a requirement of the Hedera API Protocol). While a dApp can easily obtain a list of potential Hedera Nodes, a controller may not have an all-inclusive list nor a path to the node’s gRPC endpoint. The `hedera_getNodeAddresses` method allows a dApp to request a list of node wallet addresses known to the controller. The controller should only include nodes in this list that it is willing and able to submit transactions to at the time of the request.

### Returns

1.  `Object` - signMessage result 1.1 `nodes` : `Array` - an array of strings in `<shard>.<realm>.<num><-optional-checksum>` format, each identifying a node by its Hedera Address

  <content>Methods
-------

### casper\_sign\_deploy

Use the `casper_sign_deploy` method to request the user to approve or reject the signature of a transaction (aka deploy). The wallet should validate the received deploy object and present the details to the user for his review.

#### Parameters

*   `address`. Type: `string`. The chain namespace and the public key corresponding to the key pair that signs the transaction are separated with a colon character.
*   `deploy`. Type: `object`. A Deploy object as per the Casper protocol specification.

#### Returns

*   `deploy`. Type: `object`. The Deploy object including the newly generated approval item as per the Casper protocol specification.

If the user rejects the signature, the wallet returns the WalletConnect SDK error `USER_REJECTED`.

#### Example

Request:

Response:

### casper\_sign\_message

Use `casper_sign_message` to request the user to sign a message. It’s recommended to use this method with human-readable text messages. Upon user approval, the wallet must generate a signature for the prefixed message `"Casper Message:\n" + message`. The prefix protects the user against misuse of this method, preventing a malicious actor from trying to trick the user into signing arbitrary data, like a network transaction.

#### Parameters

*   `address`. Type: `string`. The chain namespace and the public key corresponding to the key pair that signs the transaction separated with a colon character.
*   `message`. Type: `string`. The message to be signed.

#### Returns

*   `signature`. Type: `string`. The signature of the message.

If the user rejects the signature, the wallet returns the WalletConnect SDK error `USER_REJECTED`.

  <title>XRPL - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/advanced/multichain/rpc-reference/xrpl-rpc</url>
  <content>xrpl\_signTransaction
---------------------

This method is used to sign and submit a transaction to the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Every transaction has the same set of [common fields](https://xrpl.org/transaction-common-fields.html), plus additional fields based on the [transaction type](https://xrpl.org/transaction-types.html). It is expected that the dapp provides all transaction fields defined as `required`, but not necessarily the `auto-fillable`.

### Parameters

*   `Object`
    *   `tx_json` : `Object` - _(Required)_ JSON specification of the transaction.
    *   `autofill` : `Boolean` - _(Optional)_ Defaults to `true`. Set to `false` to skip auto-filling parameters.
    *   `submit` : `Boolean` - _(Optional)_ Defaults to `true`. Set to `false` to skip submitting the transaction.

Please note that if you set `submit` to `false`, your dapp will need to encode the signed `tx_json` to the required [binary format](https://xrpl.org/serialization.html#examples), before you can send it as `tx_blob` to an XRPL node using the [submit](https://xrpl.org/transaction-basics.html#example-signed-transaction-blob) command.

### Returns

*   `Object`
    *   `tx_json` : `Object` - JSON specification of the complete transaction as signed, including any fields that were auto-filled.

### Example

The example below specifies a simple DEX order for selling 15,000 XRP in exchange for 7,072.8 USD.

xrpl\_signTransactionFor
------------------------

This method is used to add a signature to a [multi-signed](https://xrpl.org/multi-signing.html#multi-signing) transaction. The same common fields and transaction types as single-signed transactions are supported.

### Parameters

*   `Object`
    *   `tx_signer` : `String` - _(Required)_ The XRPL address of the signer.
    *   `tx_json` : `Object` - _(Required)_ JSON specification of the transaction.
    *   `autofill` : `Boolean` - _(Optional)_ Defaults to `false`. Set to `true` to auto-fill parameters.
    *   `submit` : `Boolean` - _(Optional)_ Defaults to `false`. Set to `true` to submit the transaction.

Please note that `autofill` and `submit` both defaults to `false`, since explicit transaction specification and controlled submission is typically needed for multi-signed transactions.

### Returns

*   `Object`
    *   `tx_json` : `Object` - JSON specification of the complete transaction as signed, including any fields that were auto-filled.

### Example

The example below specifies a multi-signed payment transaction, already signed ([in serial](https://xrpl.org/send-a-multi-signed-transaction.html#3-get-additional-signatures)) by 3 of 4 required signers. Since only one more signature is required, the optional `submit` parameter has been set to `true`.

  <title>Bitcoin - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/advanced/multichain/rpc-reference/bitcoin-rpc</url>
  <content>We define an account as the group of addresses derived using the same account value in their [derivation paths](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki#user-content-Path_levels). We use the first address of the [external chain](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki#examples) (“first external address”), as the identifier for an account. An account’s total balance is defined as the sum of all unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) belonging to its entire group of addresses.

1.  Dapps **must** only display the first external address as a connected account.
2.  Wallets **must** only offer to connect the first external address(es).

#### Account Definition

The derivation path levels in the [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki#path-levels), [BIP49](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0049.mediawiki#user-content-Public_key_derivation), [BIP84](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0084.mediawiki#public-key-derivation), [BIP86](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0086.mediawiki#user-content-Public_key_derivation) standards are:

Addresses with different `purpose`, `change` and `address_index` values are considered to belong to the same account. Valid `purpose` values are 44, 49, 84 and 86. We use the first external Native SegWit (purpose = 84) address as the default account identifier.

For a specific seed phrase and path `m/84'/0'/0'/0/0` we get account 0 with identifier `bc1qcr8te4kr609gcawutmrza0j4xv80jy8z306fyu`. Its total balance is the sum of all UTXO balances on all addresses with derivation paths:

*   `m/44'/0'/0'/change/address_index`
*   `m/49'/0'/0'/change/address_index`
*   `m/84'/0'/0'/change/address_index`
*   `m/86'/0'/0'/change/address_index`

If the wallet user changes to account 1 we get path `m/84'/0'/1'/0/0` with identifier `bc1qku0qh0mc00y8tk0n65x2tqw4trlspak0fnjmfz`. Its total balance is the sum of all UTXO balances on all addresses with derivation paths:

*   `m/44'/0'/1'/change/address_index`
*   `m/49'/0'/1'/change/address_index`
*   `m/84'/0'/1'/change/address_index`
*   `m/86'/0'/1'/change/address_index`

sendTransfer
------------

This method is used to sign and submit a transfer of any `amount` of Bitcoin to a single `recipientAddress`, optionally including a `changeAddress` for the change amount and `memo` set as an OP\_RETURN output by supporting wallets. The transaction will be signed and broadcast upon user approval.

### Parameters

*   `Object`
    *   `account` : `String` - _(Required)_ The connected account’s first external address.
    *   `recipientAddress` : `String` - _(Required)_ The recipient’s public address.
    *   `amount` : `String` - _(Required)_ The amount of Bitcoin to send, denominated in satoshis (Bitcoin base unit).
    *   `changeAddress` : `String` - _(Optional)_ The sender’s public address to receive change.
    *   `memo` : `String` - _(Optional)_ The OP\_RETURN value as a hex string without 0x prefix, maximum 80 bytes.

### Returns

*   `Object`
    *   `txid` : `String` - _(Required)_ The transaction id as a hex string without 0x prefix.

### Example

The example below specifies a simple transfer of 1.23 BTC (123000000 Satoshi).

getAccountAddresses
-------------------

This method returns all current addresses needed for a dapp to fetch all UTXOs, calculate the total balance and prepare transactions. Dapps will typically use an indexing service to query for balances and UTXOs for all addresses returned by this method, such as:

*   [Blockbook API](https://github.com/trezor/blockbook/blob/master/docs/api.md#get-address)
*   [Bitcore API](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore/blob/master/packages/bitcore-node/docs/api-documentation.md#address)

We recognize that there are two broad classes of wallets in use today:

1.  Wallets that generate a new change or receive address for every transaction (“dynamic wallet”).
2.  Wallets that reuse the first external address for every transaction (“static wallet”).

#### Implementation Details

*   All wallets **should** include the first external address and all addresses with one or more UTXOs, unless they’re filtered by `intentions`.
*   Dynamic wallets **should** include minimum 2 unused change and receive addresses. Otherwise dapps may have to request [getAccountAddresses](https://docs.reown.com/_sites/docs.reown.com/advanced/multichain/rpc-reference/bitcoin-rpc#getAccountAddresses) after every transaction to discover the new addresses and keep track of the user’s total balance.
*   All wallets **must** return fewer than 20 unused change and receive addresses to avoid breaking the [gap limit](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki#address-gap-limit).

### Parameters

*   `Object`
    *   `account` : `String` - _(Required)_ The connected account’s first external address.
    *   `intentions` : `String[]` - _(Optional)_ Filter what addresses to return, e.g. “payment” or “ordinal”.

### Returns

*   `Array`
    *   `Object`
        *   `address` : `String` - _(Required)_ Public address belonging to the account.
        *   `publicKey` : `String` - _(Optional)_ Public key for the derivation path in hex, without 0x prefix.
        *   `path` : `String` - _(Optional)_ Derivation path of the address e.g. “m/84’/0’/0’/0/0”.
        *   `intention` : `String` - _(Optional)_ Intention of the address, e.g. “payment” or “ordinal”.

### Example: Dynamic Wallet

The example below specifies a result from a dynamic wallet. For the sake of this example, receive and change addresses with index 3-4 are considered unused and addresses with paths `m/49'/0'/0'/0/7` and `m/84'/0'/0'/0/2` are considered to have UTXOs.

Assuming the dapp monitors all returned addresses for balance changes, a new request to `getAccountAddresses` is only needed when all UTXOs in provided addresses have been spent, or when all provided `receive` addresses or `change` addresses have been used.

### Example: Static Wallet

The example below specifies a response from a static wallet. The returned address is used for both change and payments. It’s the only address with UTXOs.

signPsbt
--------

This method can be used to request the signature of a Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction (PSBT) and covers use-cases e.g. involving multiple-recipient transactions, requiring granular control over which UTXOs to spend or how to route change.

### Parameters

*   `Object`
    *   `account` : `String` - _(Required)_ The connected account’s first external address.
    *   `psbt` : `String` - _(Required)_ Base64 encoded string of the PSBT to sign.
    *   `signInputs` : `Array`
        *   `Object`
            *   `address` : `String` - _(Required)_ The address whose private key to use for signing.
            *   `index` : `Integer` - _(Required)_ Specifies which input to sign.
            *   `sighashTypes` : `Integer[]` - _(Optional)_ Specifies which part(s) of the transaction the signature commits to. Default is `[1]`.
    *   `broadcast` : `Boolean` - _(Optional)_ Whether to finalize and broadcast the transaction after signing it. Default is `false`.

### Returns

*   `Object`
    *   `psbt` : `String` - _(Required)_ The base64 encoded signed PSBT.
    *   `txid` : `String` - _(Optional)_ The transaction ID as a hex-encoded string, without 0x prefix. This must be returned if the transaction was broadcasted.

signMessage
-----------

This method is used to sign a message with one of the connected account’s addresses.

### Parameters

*   `Object`
    *   `account` : `String` - _(Required)_ The connected account’s first external address.
    *   `message` : `String` - _(Required)_ The message to be signed by the wallet.
    *   `address` : `String` - _(Optional)_ The address whose private key to use for signing the message.
    *   `protocol` : `"ecdsa" | "bip322"` - _(Optional)_ Preferred signature type. Default is `"ecdsa"`.

### Returns

*   `Object`
    *   `address` : `String` - _(Required)_ The Bitcoin address used to sign the message.
    *   `signature` : `String` - _(Required)_ Hex encoded bytes of the signature, without 0x prefix.
    *   `messageHash` : `String` - _(Optional)_ Hex encoded bytes of the message hash, without 0x prefix.

Events
------

### bip122\_addressesChanged

This event is used by wallets to notify dapps about connected accounts’ current addresses, for example all addresses with a UTXO and a few unused addresses. The event data has the same format as the [getAccountAddresses](https://docs.reown.com/_sites/docs.reown.com/advanced/multichain/rpc-reference/bitcoin-rpc#getaccountaddresses) result.

#### Implementation Details

*   Wallets **should** emit a `bip122_addressesChanged` event immediately after connection approval of a BIP122 chain.
*   Wallets **should** emit a `bip122_addressesChanged` event whenever a UTXO is spent or created for a connected account’s addresses.
*   Dapps **should** listen for `bip122_addressesChanged` events, collect and monitor all addresses for UTXO and balance changes.

  <title>Smart Contract Wallet Usage - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/advanced/api/sign/smart-contract-wallet-usage</url>
  <content>Smart Contract wallets like [Argent](https://argent.gitbook.io/argent/wallet-connect-and-argent) are fully supported by the WalletConnect protocol.

However, there are some considerations to be taken when integrating WalletConnect in your dapp for Smart Contract wallets, regarding how the accounts are exposed in the session, message signatures are returned, and transactions are broadcasted.

### Accounts

You can detect smart contract wallets by verifying on-chain if the exposed account address has any associated code deployed.

Smart contract wallets are essentially multi-signature wallets that use multiple keys to authorize operations on behalf of these smart contract accounts, so you will have to take into consideration how messages and transactions are handled by your dapp.

Messages
--------

Normally, when verifying signatures from “normal” accounts, which are Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs), you would use an ECDSA method called `ecrecover()` to retrieve the corresponding public key, which will then map to an address.

In the case of Smart Contract Wallets, you are not able to sign a message with the smart contract account. Therefore, the standard [EIP-1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271) was defined to outline a validation method which can be called on-chain, labeled `isValidSignature()`.

This method has a single parameter `_hash` which should be [EIP-191](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-191) compliant and can be computed using:

Transactions
------------

Smart Contract wallets, like [Argent](https://argent.gitbook.io/argent/wallet-connect-and-argent), commonly use the concept of meta transactions. These are a specific type of transaction that is signed by one or more key pairs but is submitted to the Ethereum network by a relayer.

The relayer pays the gas fee (in ETH), and the wallet will refund the relayer (in ETH or ERC20 tokens) up to an amount signed by the wallet’s owner.

From your dapp’s perspective, this is managed by the mobile wallet application. Your dapp will submit a regular `{ to, value, data }` transaction to the web3 provider. This transaction will be transmitted to the mobile wallet application through WalletConnect.

The mobile wallet will transform the data into a meta transaction:

*   `to` will be the `RelayerManager` contract address
*   `data` will be the encoded data of the call to the `execute()` method with the relevant parameters

Your dapp will receive the transaction hash in order to monitor the status of the transaction, and events will be emitted as usual.

The relayer has the ability to replay a transaction with a higher gas price due to fluctuating network conditions. The transaction hash is modified, and the dapp will not be aware of the new transaction hash.

One solution could be for your dapp to observe a specific event being emitted instead of the transaction status. There is currently work on standardizing events for transactions replies that has been recently proposed via [EIP-2831](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2831). We hope to improve our SDKs in the future to take this standard into account.</content>

  <title>Chain Onboarding - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/cloud/chains/overview</url>
  <content>The WalletConnect protocol is multi-chain by design. By using the [CAIP-25 standard](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-25.md), WalletConnect aims to provide a standardized process for onboarding new chains into our ecosystem. To get started, follow the following steps.

Register Chain with the Explorer
--------------------------------

If you don’t see your chain listed in this [list](https://docs.reown.com/cloud/chains/chain-list), then you will need to create an issue in GitHub to to get the process started. You can do so by clicking [here](https://github.com/WalletConnect/walletconnect-monorepo/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+new+chain+request&template=new_chain_to_explorer.md&title=). Once your chain is added to this list, wallets & dapps will be able to indicate support for your chain via WalletConnect’s [Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/).

CASA
----

To register a chain, you must know both its native representation (the chainID used with that kind of blockchain) _and_ its Chain Agnostic Standards Alliance representation, which can be found reading the relevant CAIP-2 profiles on the [CASA Namespaces Project Docs](https://namespaces.chainagnostic.org/). If no such profile yet exists, you can collaborate with an expert in the respective chain’s tooling and submit a [namespaces PR](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/namespaces/?tab=readme-ov-file#namespaces) to add one.

Add RPC Methods
---------------

Integrate RPC method support into the example wallets and dapp.

**Example Wallet**

*   [Demo](https://react-walletkit.vercel.app/)
*   [GitHub](https://github.com/WalletConnect/web-examples/tree/main/advanced/wallets/react-walletkit)

**Example Dapp**

*   [Demo](https://react-app.walletconnect.com/)
*   [GitHub](https://github.com/WalletConnect/web-examples/tree/main/advanced/dapps/react-dapp-v2)

For a chain to benefit users, its prominent wallets and dApps must be registered in the Explorer. Encourage them to join the API, allowing users to view the wallets as options when connecting to a dApp.

Wagmi & Viem
------------

If the chain you are registering is EVM compliant, we highly recommend you to integrate it with [Viem](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/chains.html), an ethereum library used by Wagmi and AppKit. To accomplish this you will need to open a GitHub Pull Request in the Viem repository.

  <title>Dogecoin - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/advanced/multichain/rpc-reference/dogecoin-rpc</url>
  <content>We define an account as the group of addresses derived using the same account value in their [derivation paths](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki#user-content-Path_levels). We use the first address of the [external chain](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki#examples) (“first external address”), as the identifier for an account. An account’s total balance is defined as the sum of all unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) belonging to its entire group of addresses.

1.  Dapps **must** only display the first external address as a connected account.
2.  Wallets **must** only offer to connect the first external address(es).

#### Account Definition

The derivation path levels in the [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki#path-levels) standard is:

Addresses with different `purpose`, `change` and `address_index` values are considered to belong to the same account. We use the first external P2PKH (purpose = 44) address as the default account identifier.

For a specific seed phrase and path `m/44'/3'/0'/0/0` we get account 0 with identifier `DTyt9wHTgizR8CwK8HAsWDaoMMxcaRuLWJ`. Its total balance is the sum of all UTXO balances on all addresses with derivation paths:

*   `m/44'/3'/0'/change/address_index`

If the wallet user changes to account 1 we get path `m/44'/3'/1'/0/0` with identifier `DBcZSePDaMMduBMLymWHXhkE5ArFEvkagU`. Its total balance is the sum of all UTXO balances on all addresses with derivation paths:

*   `m/44'/3'/1'/change/address_index`

sendTransfer
------------

This method is used to sign and submit a transfer of any `amount` of Dogecoin to a single `recipientAddress`, optionally including a `changeAddress` for the change amount and `memo` set as the OP\_RETURN value by supporting wallets. The transaction will be signed and broadcast upon user approval.

### Parameters

*   `Object`
    *   `account` : `String` - _(Required)_ The connected account’s first external address.
    *   `recipientAddress` : `String` - _(Required)_ The recipient’s public address.
    *   `amount` : `String` - _(Required)_ The amount of Dogecoin to send, denominated in satoshis (Dogecoin base unit).
    *   `changeAddress` : `String` - _(Optional)_ The sender’s public address to receive change.
    *   `memo` : `String` - _(Optional)_ The OP\_RETURN value as a hex string without 0x prefix, maximum 80 bytes.

### Returns

*   `Object`
    *   `txid` : `String` - The transaction id as a hex string without 0x prefix.

### Example

The example below specifies a simple transfer of 1.23 DOGE (123000000 Satoshi).

getAccountAddresses
-------------------

This method returns all current addresses needed for a dapp to fetch all UTXOs, calculate the total balance and prepare transactions. Dapps will typically use an indexing service to query for balances and UTXOs for all addresses returned by this method, such as:

*   [Blockbook API](https://github.com/trezor/blockbook/blob/master/docs/api.md#get-address)
*   [Bitcore API](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore/blob/master/packages/bitcore-node/docs/api-documentation.md#address)

We recognize that there are two broad classes of wallets in use today:

1.  Wallets that generate a new change or receive address for every transaction (“dynamic wallet”).
2.  Wallets that reuse the first external address for every transaction (“static wallet”).

#### Implementation Details

*   All wallets **should** include the first external address and all addresses with one or more UTXOs, unless they’re filtered by `intentions`.
*   Dynamic wallets **should** include minimum 2 unused change and receive addresses. Otherwise dapps may have to request [getAccountAddresses](https://docs.reown.com/_sites/docs.reown.com/advanced/multichain/rpc-reference/dogecoin-rpc#getAccountAddresses) after every transaction to discover the new addresses and keep track of the user’s total balance.
*   All wallets **must** return fewer than 20 unused change and receive addresses to avoid breaking the [gap limit](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki#address-gap-limit).

### Parameters

*   `Object`
    *   `account` : `String` - _(Required)_ The connected account’s first external address.
    *   `intentions` : `String[]` - _(Optional)_ Filter what addresses to return, e.g. “payment” or “ordinal”.

### Returns

*   `Array`
    *   `Object`
        *   `address` : `String` - _(Required)_ Public address belonging to the account.
        *   `publicKey` : `String` - _(Optional)_ Public key for the derivation path in hex, without 0x prefix.
        *   `path` : `String` - _(Optional)_ Derivation path of the address e.g. “m/44’/3’/0’/0/0”.
        *   `intention` : `String` - _(Optional)_ Intention of the address, e.g. “payment” or “ordinal”.

### Example: Dynamic Wallet

The example below specifies a result from a dynamic wallet. For the sake of this example, receive and change addresses with index 3-4 are considered unused and address with path `m/44'/3'/0'/0/2` is considered to have UTXOs.

Assuming the dapp monitors all returned addresses for balance changes, a new request to `getAccountAddresses` is only needed when all UTXOs in provided addresses have been spent, or when all provided `receive` addresses or `change` addresses have been used.

### Example: Static Wallet

The example below specifies a response from a static wallet. The returned address is used for both change and payments. It’s the only address with UTXOs.

signPsbt
--------

This method can be used to request the signature of a Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction (PSBT) and covers use-cases e.g. involving multiple-recipient transactions, requiring granular control over which UTXOs to spend or how to route change.

### Parameters

*   `Object`
    *   `account` : `String` - _(Required)_ The connected account’s first external address.
    *   `psbt` : `String` - _(Required)_ Base64 encoded string of the PSBT to sign.
    *   `signInputs` : `Array`
        *   `Object`
            *   `address` : `String` - _(Required)_ The address whose private key to use for signing.
            *   `index` : `Integer` - _(Required)_ Specifies which input to sign.
            *   `sighashTypes` : `Integer[]` - _(Optional)_ Specifies which part(s) of the transaction the signature commits to. Default is `[1]`.
    *   `broadcast` : `Boolean` - _(Optional)_ Whether to finalize and broadcast the transaction after signing it. Default is `false`.

### Returns

*   `Object`
    *   `psbt` : `String` - _(Required)_ The base64 encoded signed PSBT.
    *   `txid` : `String` - _(Optional)_ The transaction ID as a hex-encoded string, without 0x prefix. This must be returned if the transaction was broadcasted.

signMessage
-----------

This method is used to sign a message with one of the connected account’s addresses.

### Parameters

*   `Object`
    *   `account` : `String` - _(Required)_ The connected account’s first external address.
    *   `message` : `String` - _(Required)_ The message to be signed by the wallet.
    *   `address` : `String` - _(Optional)_ The address whose private key to use for signing the message.
    *   `protocol` : `"ecdsa" | "bip322"` - _(Optional)_ Preferred signature type. Default is `"ecdsa"`.

### Returns

*   `Object`
    *   `address` : `String` - _(Required)_ The Dogecoin address used to sign the message.
    *   `signature` : `String` - _(Required)_ Hex encoded bytes of the signature, without 0x prefix.
    *   `messageHash` : `String` - _(Optional)_ Hex encoded bytes of the message hash, without 0x prefix.

Events
------

### bip122\_addressesChanged

This event is used by wallets to notify dapps about connected accounts’ current addresses, for example all addresses with a UTXO and a few unused addresses. The event data has the same format as the [getAccountAddresses](https://docs.reown.com/_sites/docs.reown.com/advanced/multichain/rpc-reference/dogecoin-rpc#getaccountaddresses) result.

#### Implementation Details

*   Wallets **should** emit a `bip122_addressesChanged` event immediately after connection approval of a BIP122 chain.
*   Wallets **should** emit a `bip122_addressesChanged` event whenever a UTXO is spent or created for a connected account’s addresses.
*   Dapps **should** listen for `bip122_addressesChanged` events, collect and monitor all addresses for UTXO and balance changes.

  <title>Usage - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/notifications/frontend-integration/usage</url>
  <content>AppKit Notifications provides you the building blocks necessary to allow users to subscribe, receive notifications, and manage notification preferences, all from your app’s UI. The Web3Inbox SDK supports both React hooks and JavaScript-based integrations.

Before begin using Web3Inbox, you will first need to [setup your project](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/notifications/cloud-setup) to send notifications.

Installation
------------

Example Usage
-------------

This basic example demonstrates how to use the AppKit Notifications to subscribe to notifications and receive them in your app. Refer to the [API Reference](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/notifications/frontend-integration/api) for more details on the available methods.

Below is an example of adding the Web3Inbox SDK to a React project with wagmi. Wagmi is not required to use the Web3Inbox React hooks.

We have separated it so the initialization can be done executed once in the app, and the hooks can be used anywhere in the app.

UX Guidelines
-------------

For the best user experience we have several recommendations on how to build the Web3Inbox flows into your app:

*   Have an explicit opt-in UI to subscribe to notifications. Some users may not want to receive notifications, and enabling notifications requires the user to sign a message with their blockchain account. Enabling notifications should be optional, and if they do enable them they should be told that they will need to sign a message to enable this.
*   Have a button to unsubscribe from notifications once they are enabled. Users may want to stop receiving notifications, so you should have a button to unsubscribe from notifications if the user wants to.
*   Make use of [notification types](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/notifications/cloud-setup#notification-types). These allow the user fine-grained control over what types of notifications they want to receive from your app. These allow users to only unsubscribe from the specific notifications they are no longer interested in, rather than needing to unsubscribe from your entire app. Your app should include functionality to manage notification preferences.

  <title>Relay Client - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/advanced/api/core/relay</url>
  <content>Relay client provides transport layer for Sign, Auth and Chat SDKs. You can configure it once and every SDK will transport protocol messages via same instance of a relay client with only one opened websocket connection. The Relay API can be accessed through the Core Client

Before using Sign or Auth SDK, it is necessary to configure a shared Networking Client instance. Set a project ID generated when starting a project on Reown Cloud and SocketFactory instance.

WalletConnect Swift SDK does not depend on any websocket library. SocketFactory parameter allows you to pass your own implementation of websocket connection.

Here’s an example of WebSocketFactory implementation using Starscream v3

Please note that if you have made changes to the list of **Allowed Domains** in the **Reown Cloud Dashboard**, then you may encounter an error with the connection if you use **Starscream** or any other socket client. For example, the native implementation of **Starscream** will use the `relay.walletconnect.com` as an `Origin` parameter if not provided, which will be missing from the list of **Allowed Domains**. The solution to this could be the inclusion of the `relay.walletconnect.com` in the **Allowed Domains**, corresponding changes in the socket client implementation, or following changes in the `WebSocketFactory`.

Create and register App Group Identifier in [Apple Developer Center](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list/applicationGroup) if needed and provide it during Networking client configuration.

#### Networking client configuration

`groupIdentifier` - App group identifier, created on [Apple Developer Center](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list/applicationGrou). Enables to share keychain items between the Notify SDK and a UNNotificationServiceExtension to receive and decrypt push notifications.

#### Web Socket Connection

By default web socket connection is handled internally by the SDK. That means that Web socket will be safely disconnected when apps go to background and it will connect back when app reaches foreground. But if it is not expected for your app and you want to handle socket connection manually you can do it as follows:

1.  set socketConnectionType for manual

2.  control socket connection:</content>

  <title>SIWX Default Usage - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/core/siwx-default</url>
  <content>The Sign In With X feature enables decentralized applications (Dapps) to authenticate users seamlessly across multiple blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, Polygon or Solana. The user can connect and then sign a message with their account to prove ownership of the account.

Quick Start
-----------

Here is a quick guide to get started with the **SIWX** feature using the default implementation.

### Example

[

Next.js MultiChain SIWX Default Example
---------------------------------------

Check the Next.js example using DefaultSIWX in a multi-chain environment



](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit-web-examples/blob/main/nextjs/next-siwx-multichain/)

### Installation

### Usage

You should now have the **SIWX** feature up and running in your Dapp.

The `DefaultSIWX` configuration will use the predefined components to handle the message generation, verification and storage of the sessions. You can customize the default implementation by providing your own components as in the following sections.

Customizing the Default Implementation
--------------------------------------

The default implementation of **SIWX** is divided in three main components: `SIWXMessenger`, `SIWXVerifier` and `SIWXStorage`. The `@reown/appkit-siwx` package have defined options to fulfill the parts when initializing the `DefaultSIWX` configuration and you are also able to setup your own parts as required.

### Predefined Components

The `@reown/appkit-siwx` package provides some predefined components that you can use to quickly setup the `DefaultSIWX` configuration.

Check the latest components over the [SIWX repository](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/tree/main/packages/siwx)

#### Customizing components

You may provide the parts to the `DefaultSIWX` configuration using the predefined components exposed by `@reown/appkit-siwx` package and customize the component params as needed.

### Custom Components

You may create your own components to handle the message generation, verification and storage of the sessions. The following sections will guide you through the process of creating your own components.

#### `SIWXMessenger`

The [`SIWXMessenger`](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/blob/main/packages/siwx/src/core/SIWXMessenger.ts) is an abstract class which holds methods for generating the message to be signed.

##### Creating a Custom Messenger:

You may extend the `SIWXMessenger` class adding the public attributes:

*   `version`: a string that represents the version of the messenger;
*   `stringify`: a method that receives the message data and returns a string to be signed.

#### `SIWXVerifier`

The [`SIWXVerifier`](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/blob/main/packages/siwx/src/core/SIWXVerifier.ts) is an abstract class that defines the verification logic for the signed message.

##### Creating a Custom Verifier:

You may extend the `SIWXVerifier` class adding the public attributes:

*   `chainNamespace`: a string that represents the chain namespace for the verifier;
*   `verify`: a method that receives the session data and returns a boolean indicating if the session is valid.

#### `SIWXStorage`

[

Next.js SIWX Default Example with supabase storage
--------------------------------------------------

Check the Next.js example using DefaultSIWX and supabase as default storage



](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit-web-examples/tree/main/nextjs/next-siwx-multichain-supabase-storage)

[`SIWXStorage`](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/blob/main/packages/siwx/src/core/SIWXStorage.ts) is a interface that defines how the session data will be stored.

##### Creating a Custom Storage:

You may implement the `SIWXStorage` interface with the following methods:

*   `add`: This method will be called to store a new single session that is verified;
*   `set`: This method must replace all the sessions in the storage with the new ones;
*   `get`: This method must return all the sessions stored for a specific chain and address. Is expected that the sessions are already verified;
*   `delete`: This method must delete all the sessions stored for a specific chain and address.

#### Using custom components

You may provide your custom components to the `DefaultSIWX` configuration.

If you omit any of the components, the default implementation will be used. Check [here](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/blob/main/packages/siwx/src/configs/DefaultSIWX.ts) the default components.</content>

  <title>Cloud Auth SIWX Usage - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/core/siwx-cloud-auth</url>
  <content>Cloud Auth SIWX is a predefined implementation of the SIWX configuration plugin that uses the Cloud service to create and manage SIWX messages and sessions.

With Cloud Auth SIWX you will be able to see and control the sessions of your users using the [User Management Dashboard](https://docs.reown.com/_sites/docs.reown.com/appkit/react/core/siwx-cloud-auth#user-management).

### Installation

### Usage

Now you are ready to use the **SIWX** feature in your Dapp.

User Management
---------------

Easily view and manage all authenticated users through AppKit [Cloud Auth SIWX](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/authentication/siwx/siwx-cloud-auth), a drop-in hosted SIWX server that provides key insights into your user base.

### Dashboard

The dashboard provides a list of all accounts (chain + address) connected to your dapp, including the country they connected from, the last connection time, and the authentication method (wallet or social login).

### Insights

We plan to add more insights over time. Currently, it includes:

*   **Connections**: Authenticated users over time
*   **Geographic Distribution**: User distribution by country
*   **Wallet Analytics**: Which wallets are most commonly used
*   **30-Day History**: Historical data for the past 30 days

  <title>SIWX Custom Usage - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/core/siwx-custom</url>
  <content>Alternatively from the [Default Implementation](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/core/siwx-default), you can create your own implementation of the **SIWX** feature to suit your specific requirements.

**SIWX** is developed to work as a plugin system for AppKit and to enable correctly it you need to fulfill the expected interface within the `createAppKit` function.

SIWXConfig interface
--------------------

This is the interface that you need to implement to create your own **SIWX** feature.

All the typings used are exposed by `@reown/appkit-core` package. You may check the source code [here](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/blob/main/packages/core/src/utils/SIWXUtil.ts).

You are able to implement the `SIWXConfig` in the way you would like, but some constraints MUST be followed to make sure that AppKit can interact with it correctly and it will work as expected:

### `createMessage`

This method will be called to create a new message to be signed by the user.

*   The message MUST be unique and contain all the necessary information to verify the user’s identity.

### `addSession`

This method will be called to store a new single session.

*   This method MUST verify if the session is valid and store it in the storage successfully.

### `revokeSession`

This method will be called to revoke all the sessions stored for a specific chain and address.

*   This method MUST delete all the sessions stored for the specific chain and address successfully.

### `setSessions`

This method will be called to replace all the sessions in the storage with the new ones.

*   This method MUST verify all the sessions before storing them in the storage;
*   This method MUST replace all the sessions in the storage with the new ones successfully otherwise it MUST throw an error.

### `getSessions`

This method will be called to get all the sessions stored for a specific chain and address.

*   This method MUST return only sessions that are verified and valid;
*   This method MUST NOT return expired sessions.

  <title>Migration Guide - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/notifications/frontend-integration/migration-guide</url>
  <content>General Migration notes
-----------------------

*   `isLimited` flag has been removed in favor of `allApps` flag. They essentially mean the opposite thing.
*   Deleting messages is no longer possible
*   Messages are now stored on notify server and can be paged
*   Registration is more flexible since it is now split into 2 functions

Migrating from 0.x to 1.0.0
---------------------------

There are numerous breaking changes in the stable release.

#### Package rename

`@web3inbox/widget-react` has been renamed to `@web3inbox/react`

`@web3inbox/core` is still named the same.

#### Initializing the client

Previously, a use of hook was required to init the client and a separate hook was required to check for ready status. Now, there is only a hook for checking ready status which is **recommended** to be used to be sure if web3inbox functionality is ready to use. However, initiating the client is now done with a simple function call.

#### Checking for client ready status

#### Managing Accounts

Previously, the account needed to be set using `setAccount` and still had to be passed down to hooks like `useManageSubscriptions`. This is no longer the case. Also, registration management was included in the same hook. Now they all follow single responsibility principle.

*   **Setting accounts**

*   **Handling registration**

#### Managing notifications

Messages (notifications) function a little differently now. One of the big changes is that you can no longer delete messages. Furthermore, messages can now be paged. For convenience, “infinite scroll” paging functionality is available, as in keeping older pages in the returned array.

*   **Retrieving notifications**

*   **Retrieving notification types**

Sizes of images available are: `sm`, `md` and `lg` for small, medium and large respectively.

#### Managing Subscriptions

Managing subscriptions has changed considerably. Previously there was a single hook and now there are numerous single responsibility hooks.</content>

  <title>Usage - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/javascript/notifications/frontend-integration/usage</url>
  <content>AppKit Notifications provides you the building blocks necessary to allow users to subscribe, receive notifications, and manage notification preferences, all from your app’s UI. The Web3Inbox SDK supports both React hooks and JavaScript-based integrations.

Before begin using Web3Inbox, you will first need to [setup your project](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/javascript/notifications/cloud-setup) to send notifications.

Installation
------------

Example Usage
-------------

This basic example demonstrates how to use the AppKit Notifications to subscribe to notifications and receive them in your app. Refer to the [API Reference](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/javascript/notifications/frontend-integration/api) for more details on the available methods.

UX Guidelines
-------------

For the best user experience we have several recommendations on how to build the Web3Inbox flows into your app:

*   Have an explicit opt-in UI to subscribe to notifications. Some users may not want to receive notifications, and enabling notifications requires the user to sign a message with their blockchain account. Enabling notifications should be optional, and if they do enable them they should be told that they will need to sign a message to enable this.
*   Have a button to unsubscribe from notifications once they are enabled. Users may want to stop receiving notifications, so you should have a button to unsubscribe from notifications if the user wants to.
*   Make use of [notification types](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/javascript/notifications/cloud-setup#notification-types). These allow the user fine-grained control over what types of notifications they want to receive from your app. These allow users to only unsubscribe from the specific notifications they are no longer interested in, rather than needing to unsubscribe from your entire app. Your app should include functionality to manage notification preferences.

  <title>Authorization Signatures - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/notifications/authorization-signatures/overview</url>
  <content>When a user wants to enable notifications with an app or wallet, they must sign a SIWE message with their account granting that app access to view and manage their notifications. The SIWE message varies depending on whether the app is requesting access to manage all app notifications, or just that app’s notifications. Below are the two possible SIWE messages the user would be requested to sign:

*   [I authorize \[…\] this app](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/notifications/authorization-signatures/this-app)
*   [I authorize \[…\] all apps](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/notifications/authorization-signatures/all-apps)</content>

  <title>Signing the message: “I further authorize this app to view and manage my notifications for ALL apps” - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/notifications/authorization-signatures/all-apps</url>
  <content>When subscribing to notifications from an app that uses Web3Inbox, you may be presented with a signature request that reads the following message:

> I further authorize this app to view and manage my notifications for ALL apps. Read more at [https://walletconnect.com/notifications-all-apps](https://walletconnect.com/notifications-all-apps)

For any signature request, it’s critical that you always read the message attached before signing in order to fully understand the permissions you’re granting.

Take caution when signing this request as doing so will allow the app to:

*   Subscribe you to notifications from any app
*   Manage your notifications for any app
*   View your notifications from any app

The app will not be able to:

*   Sign blockchain transactions or additional messages

Typically, apps you subscribe to for notifications will send a slightly [different request](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/notifications/authorization-signatures/this-app) that asks you to only authorize them to manage notifications _for that app only_ upon signing. You should only ever be presented with the message shown in the example above when an app requires wider access to your subscriptions and messages.

A common example of this would be an app that enables you to view notifications and messages from multiple apps, like a wallet or the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/).

Always be cautious when granting this permission to an app, and ensure that you’re familiar with the app sending the request.

For developers using `@web3inbox/core` without the hooks, there are far less breaking changes.

#### Managing registration

Registration is now split into 2 steps to avoid the opinionated approach of passing `onSign` callback.

#### Managing Notifications

*   `deleteMessage` has been removed.
*   `pageNotifications` has been added to allow paging notifications

  <title>SIWX Default - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/next/core/siwx-default</url>
  <content>SIWX Default Usage
------------------

The Sign In With X feature enables decentralized applications (Dapps) to authenticate users seamlessly across multiple blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, Polygon or Solana. The user can connect and then sign a message with their account to prove ownership of the account.

Quick Start
-----------

Here is a quick guide to get started with the **SIWX** feature using the default implementation.

### Example

[

Next.js MultiChain SIWX Default Example
---------------------------------------

Check the Next.js example using DefaultSIWX in a multi-chain environment



](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit-web-examples/blob/main/nextjs/next-siwx-multichain/)

### Installation

### Usage

You should now have the **SIWX** feature up and running in your Dapp.

The `DefaultSIWX` configuration will use the predefined components to handle the message generation, verification and storage of the sessions. You can customize the default implementation by providing your own components as in the following sections.

Customizing the Default Implementation
--------------------------------------

The default implementation of **SIWX** is divided in three main components: `SIWXMessenger`, `SIWXVerifier` and `SIWXStorage`. The `@reown/appkit-siwx` package have defined options to fulfill the parts when initializing the `DefaultSIWX` configuration and you are also able to setup your own parts as required.

### Predefined Components

The `@reown/appkit-siwx` package provides some predefined components that you can use to quickly setup the `DefaultSIWX` configuration.

Check the latest components over the [SIWX repository](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/tree/main/packages/siwx)

#### Customizing components

You may provide the parts to the `DefaultSIWX` configuration using the predefined components exposed by `@reown/appkit-siwx` package and customize the component params as needed.

### Custom Components

You may create your own components to handle the message generation, verification and storage of the sessions. The following sections will guide you through the process of creating your own components.

#### `SIWXMessenger`

The [`SIWXMessenger`](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/blob/main/packages/siwx/src/core/SIWXMessenger.ts) is an abstract class which holds methods for generating the message to be signed.

##### Creating a Custom Messenger:

You may extend the `SIWXMessenger` class adding the public attributes:

*   `version`: a string that represents the version of the messenger;
*   `stringify`: a method that receives the message data and returns a string to be signed.

#### `SIWXVerifier`

The [`SIWXVerifier`](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/blob/main/packages/siwx/src/core/SIWXVerifier.ts) is an abstract class that defines the verification logic for the signed message.

##### Creating a Custom Verifier:

You may extend the `SIWXVerifier` class adding the public attributes:

*   `chainNamespace`: a string that represents the chain namespace for the verifier;
*   `verify`: a method that receives the session data and returns a boolean indicating if the session is valid.

#### `SIWXStorage`

[

Next.js SIWX Default Example with supabase storage
--------------------------------------------------

Check the Next.js example using DefaultSIWX and supabase as default storage



](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit-web-examples/tree/main/nextjs/next-siwx-multichain-supabase-storage)

[`SIWXStorage`](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/blob/main/packages/siwx/src/core/SIWXStorage.ts) is a interface that defines how the session data will be stored.

##### Creating a Custom Storage:

You may implement the `SIWXStorage` interface with the following methods:

*   `add`: This method will be called to store a new single session that is verified;
*   `set`: This method must replace all the sessions in the storage with the new ones;
*   `get`: This method must return all the sessions stored for a specific chain and address. Is expected that the sessions are already verified;
*   `delete`: This method must delete all the sessions stored for a specific chain and address.

#### Using custom components

You may provide your custom components to the `DefaultSIWX` configuration.

If you omit any of the components, the default implementation will be used. Check [here](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/blob/main/packages/siwx/src/configs/DefaultSIWX.ts) the default components.</content>

  <title>SIWX Custom - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/next/core/siwx-custom</url>
  <content>SIWX Custom Usage
-----------------

Alternatively from the [Default Implementation](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/next/core/siwx-default), you can create your own implementation of the **SIWX** feature to suit your specific requirements.

**SIWX** is developed to work as a plugin system for AppKit and to enable correctly it you need to fulfill the expected interface within the `createAppKit` function.

SIWXConfig interface
--------------------

This is the interface that you need to implement to create your own **SIWX** feature.

All the typings used are exposed by `@reown/appkit-core` package. You may check the source code [here](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/blob/main/packages/core/src/utils/SIWXUtil.ts).

Constraints
-----------

You are able to implement the `SIWXConfig` in the way you would like, but some constraints MUST be followed to make sure that AppKit can interact with it correctly and it will work as expected:

### `createMessage`

This method will be called to create a new message to be signed by the user.

*   The message MUST be unique and contain all the necessary information to verify the user’s identity.

### `addSession`

This method will be called to store a new single session.

*   This method MUST verify if the session is valid and store it in the storage successfully.

### `revokeSession`

This method will be called to revoke all the sessions stored for a specific chain and address.

*   This method MUST delete all the sessions stored for the specific chain and address successfully.

### `setSessions`

This method will be called to replace all the sessions in the storage with the new ones.

*   This method MUST verify all the sessions before storing them in the storage;
*   This method MUST replace all the sessions in the storage with the new ones successfully otherwise it MUST throw an error.

### `getSessions`

This method will be called to get all the sessions stored for a specific chain and address.

*   This method MUST return only sessions that are verified and valid;
*   This method MUST NOT return expired sessions.

  <title>Migration Guide - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/next/notifications/frontend-integration/migration-guide</url>
  <content>General Migration notes
-----------------------

*   `isLimited` flag has been removed in favor of `allApps` flag. They essentially mean the opposite thing.
*   Deleting messages is no longer possible
*   Messages are now stored on notify server and can be paged
*   Registration is more flexible since it is now split into 2 functions

Migrating from 0.x to 1.0.0
---------------------------

There are numerous breaking changes in the stable release.

#### Package rename

`@web3inbox/widget-react` has been renamed to `@web3inbox/react`

`@web3inbox/core` is still named the same.

#### Initializing the client

Previously, a use of hook was required to init the client and a separate hook was required to check for ready status. Now, there is only a hook for checking ready status which is **recommended** to be used to be sure if web3inbox functionality is ready to use. However, initiating the client is now done with a simple function call.

#### Checking for client ready status

#### Managing Accounts

Previously, the account needed to be set using `setAccount` and still had to be passed down to hooks like `useManageSubscriptions`. This is no longer the case. Also, registration management was included in the same hook. Now they all follow single responsibility principle.

*   **Setting accounts**

*   **Handling registration**

#### Managing notifications

Messages (notifications) function a little differently now. One of the big changes is that you can no longer delete messages. Furthermore, messages can now be paged. For convenience, “infinite scroll” paging functionality is available, as in keeping older pages in the returned array.

*   **Retrieving notifications**

*   **Retrieving notification types**

Sizes of images available are: `sm`, `md` and `lg` for small, medium and large respectively.

#### Managing Subscriptions

Managing subscriptions has changed considerably. Previously there was a single hook and now there are numerous single responsibility hooks.</content>

  <title>Authorization Signatures - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/next/notifications/authorization-signatures/overview</url>
  <content>When a user wants to enable notifications with an app or wallet, they must sign a SIWE message with their account granting that app access to view and manage their notifications. The SIWE message varies depending on whether the app is requesting access to manage all app notifications, or just that app’s notifications. Below are the two possible SIWE messages the user would be requested to sign:

*   [I authorize \[…\] this app](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/next/notifications/authorization-signatures/this-app)
*   [I authorize \[…\] all apps](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/next/notifications/authorization-signatures/all-apps)</content>
</page>

<page>
  <title>Signing the message: “I further authorize this app to view and manage my notifications for ALL apps” - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/next/notifications/authorization-signatures/all-apps</url>
  <content>When subscribing to notifications from an app that uses Web3Inbox, you may be presented with a signature request that reads the following message:

> I further authorize this app to view and manage my notifications for ALL apps. Read more at [https://walletconnect.com/notifications-all-apps](https://walletconnect.com/notifications-all-apps)

For any signature request, it’s critical that you always read the message attached before signing in order to fully understand the permissions you’re granting.

Take caution when signing this request as doing so will allow the app to:

*   Subscribe you to notifications from any app
*   Manage your notifications for any app
*   View your notifications from any app

The app will not be able to:

*   Sign blockchain transactions or additional messages

Typically, apps you subscribe to for notifications will send a slightly [different request](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/next/notifications/authorization-signatures/this-app) that asks you to only authorize them to manage notifications _for that app only_ upon signing. You should only ever be presented with the message shown in the example above when an app requires wider access to your subscriptions and messages.

A common example of this would be an app that enables you to view notifications and messages from multiple apps, like a wallet or the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/).

Always be cautious when granting this permission to an app, and ensure that you’re familiar with the app sending the request.

  <title>SIWX Default - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/vue/core/siwx-default</url>
  <content>SIWX Default Usage
------------------

The Sign In With X feature enables decentralized applications (Dapps) to authenticate users seamlessly across multiple blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, Polygon or Solana. The user can connect and then sign a message with their account to prove ownership of the account.

Quick Start
-----------

Here is a quick guide to get started with the **SIWX** feature using the default implementation.

### Example

[

Next.js MultiChain SIWX Default Example
---------------------------------------

Check the Next.js example using DefaultSIWX in a multi-chain environment



](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit-web-examples/blob/main/nextjs/next-siwx-multichain/)

### Installation

### Usage

You should now have the **SIWX** feature up and running in your Dapp.

The `DefaultSIWX` configuration will use the predefined components to handle the message generation, verification and storage of the sessions. You can customize the default implementation by providing your own components as in the following sections.

Customizing the Default Implementation
--------------------------------------

The default implementation of **SIWX** is divided in three main components: `SIWXMessenger`, `SIWXVerifier` and `SIWXStorage`. The `@reown/appkit-siwx` package have defined options to fulfill the parts when initializing the `DefaultSIWX` configuration and you are also able to setup your own parts as required.

### Predefined Components

The `@reown/appkit-siwx` package provides some predefined components that you can use to quickly setup the `DefaultSIWX` configuration.

Check the latest components over the [SIWX repository](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/tree/main/packages/siwx)

#### Customizing components

You may provide the parts to the `DefaultSIWX` configuration using the predefined components exposed by `@reown/appkit-siwx` package and customize the component params as needed.

### Custom Components

You may create your own components to handle the message generation, verification and storage of the sessions. The following sections will guide you through the process of creating your own components.

#### `SIWXMessenger`

The [`SIWXMessenger`](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/blob/main/packages/siwx/src/core/SIWXMessenger.ts) is an abstract class which holds methods for generating the message to be signed.

##### Creating a Custom Messenger:

You may extend the `SIWXMessenger` class adding the public attributes:

*   `version`: a string that represents the version of the messenger;
*   `stringify`: a method that receives the message data and returns a string to be signed.

#### `SIWXVerifier`

The [`SIWXVerifier`](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/blob/main/packages/siwx/src/core/SIWXVerifier.ts) is an abstract class that defines the verification logic for the signed message.

##### Creating a Custom Verifier:

You may extend the `SIWXVerifier` class adding the public attributes:

*   `chainNamespace`: a string that represents the chain namespace for the verifier;
*   `verify`: a method that receives the session data and returns a boolean indicating if the session is valid.

#### `SIWXStorage`

[

Next.js SIWX Default Example with supabase storage
--------------------------------------------------

Check the Next.js example using DefaultSIWX and supabase as default storage



](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit-web-examples/tree/main/nextjs/next-siwx-multichain-supabase-storage)

[`SIWXStorage`](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/blob/main/packages/siwx/src/core/SIWXStorage.ts) is a interface that defines how the session data will be stored.

##### Creating a Custom Storage:

You may implement the `SIWXStorage` interface with the following methods:

*   `add`: This method will be called to store a new single session that is verified;
*   `set`: This method must replace all the sessions in the storage with the new ones;
*   `get`: This method must return all the sessions stored for a specific chain and address. Is expected that the sessions are already verified;
*   `delete`: This method must delete all the sessions stored for a specific chain and address.

#### Using custom components

You may provide your custom components to the `DefaultSIWX` configuration.

If you omit any of the components, the default implementation will be used. Check [here](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/blob/main/packages/siwx/src/configs/DefaultSIWX.ts) the default components.</content>

  <title>SIWX Custom - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/next/core/siwx-cloud-auth</url>
  <content>Cloud Auth SIWX Usage
---------------------

Cloud Auth SIWX is a predefined implementation of the SIWX configuration plugin that uses the Cloud service to create and manage SIWX messages and sessions.

With Cloud Auth SIWX you will be able to see and control the sessions of your users using the [User Management Dashboard](https://docs.reown.com/_sites/docs.reown.com/appkit/next/core/siwx-cloud-auth#user-management).

### Installation

### Usage

Now you are ready to use the **SIWX** feature in your Dapp.

User Management
---------------

Easily view and manage all authenticated users through AppKit [Cloud Auth SIWX](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/authentication/siwx/siwx-cloud-auth), a drop-in hosted SIWX server that provides key insights into your user base.

### Dashboard

The dashboard provides a list of all accounts (chain + address) connected to your dapp, including the country they connected from, the last connection time, and the authentication method (wallet or social login).

### Insights

We plan to add more insights over time. Currently, it includes:

*   **Connections**: Authenticated users over time
*   **Geographic Distribution**: User distribution by country
*   **Wallet Analytics**: Which wallets are most commonly used
*   **30-Day History**: Historical data for the past 30 days

  <title>Authorization Signatures - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/javascript/notifications/authorization-signatures/overview</url>
  <content>When a user wants to enable notifications with an app or wallet, they must sign a SIWE message with their account granting that app access to view and manage their notifications. The SIWE message varies depending on whether the app is requesting access to manage all app notifications, or just that app’s notifications. Below are the two possible SIWE messages the user would be requested to sign:

*   [I authorize \[…\] this app](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/javascript/notifications/authorization-signatures/this-app)
*   [I authorize \[…\] all apps](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/javascript/notifications/authorization-signatures/all-apps)</content>

  <title>Migration Guide - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/javascript/notifications/frontend-integration/migration-guide</url>
  <content>General Migration notes
-----------------------

*   `isLimited` flag has been removed in favor of `allApps` flag. They essentially mean the opposite thing.
*   Deleting messages is no longer possible
*   Messages are now stored on notify server and can be paged
*   Registration is more flexible since it is now split into 2 functions

Migrating from 0.x to 1.0.0
---------------------------

For developers using `@web3inbox/core` without the hooks, there are far less breaking changes.

#### Managing registration

Registration is now split into 2 steps to avoid the opinionated approach of passing `onSign` callback.

#### Managing Notifications

*   `deleteMessage` has been removed.
*   `pageNotifications` has been added to allow paging notifications

  <title>Signing the message: “I further authorize this app to view and manage my notifications for ALL apps” - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/javascript/notifications/authorization-signatures/all-apps</url>
  <content>When subscribing to notifications from an app that uses Web3Inbox, you may be presented with a signature request that reads the following message:

> I further authorize this app to view and manage my notifications for ALL apps. Read more at [https://walletconnect.com/notifications-all-apps](https://walletconnect.com/notifications-all-apps)

For any signature request, it’s critical that you always read the message attached before signing in order to fully understand the permissions you’re granting.

Take caution when signing this request as doing so will allow the app to:

*   Subscribe you to notifications from any app
*   Manage your notifications for any app
*   View your notifications from any app

The app will not be able to:

*   Sign blockchain transactions or additional messages

Typically, apps you subscribe to for notifications will send a slightly [different request](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/javascript/notifications/authorization-signatures/this-app) that asks you to only authorize them to manage notifications _for that app only_ upon signing. You should only ever be presented with the message shown in the example above when an app requires wider access to your subscriptions and messages.

A common example of this would be an app that enables you to view notifications and messages from multiple apps, like a wallet or the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/).

Always be cautious when granting this permission to an app, and ensure that you’re familiar with the app sending the request.

  <title>Chain Abstraction - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/react-native/early-access/chain-abstraction</url>
  <content>Chain Abstraction in WalletKit enables users with stablecoins on any network to spend them on-the-fly on a different network. Our Chain Abstraction solution provides a toolkit for wallet developers to integrate this complex functionality using WalletKit.

For example, when an app requests a 100 USDC payment on Base network but the user only has USDC on Arbitrum, WalletKit offers methods to detect this mismatch, generate necessary transactions, track the cross-chain transfer, and complete the original transaction after bridging finishes.

How It Works
------------

When sending a transaction, you need to:

1.  Check if the required chain has enough funds to complete the transaction
2.  If not, use the `prepare` method to generate necessary bridging transactions
3.  Check the status of the bridging transactions and wait for them to complete
4.  Once the bridging transactions are completed, execute the initial transaction

The following sequence diagram illustrates the complete flow of a chain abstraction operation, from the initial dapp request to the final transaction confirmation

Methods
-------

Following are the methods from WalletKit that you will use in implementing chain abstraction.

### Prepare

This method checks if a transaction requires additional bridging transactions beforehand.

### Status

Helper method used to check the fulfilment status of a bridging operation.

### Usage

When sending a transaction, first check if chain abstraction is needed using the `prepare` method. If it is needed, you need to sign all the fulfillment transactions and broadcast them in parallel. After that, you need to call the `status` method to check the status of the fulfillment operation.

If the operation is successful, you need to broadcast the initial transaction and await the transaction hash and receipt. If the operation is not successful, you need to send the JsonRpcError to the dapp and display the error to the user.

Types
-----

Following are the types that are used in the chain abstraction methods.

For example, check out implementation of chain abstraction in [sample wallet](https://github.com/reown-com/react-native-examples/pull/185) with React Native CLI.

Testing
-------

To test Chain Abstraction, you can use the [AppKit laboratory](https://appkit-lab.reown.com/library/wagmi/) and try sending [USDC/USDT](https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/features/early-access/chain-abstraction.mdx#what-are-the-supported-tokens-and-networks) with any chain abstraction supported wallet. You can also use this [sample wallet](https://appdistribution.firebase.google.com/testerapps/1:222905275039:android:799d1c9291d92ebe8c88aa/releases/7tkfoelis7n08) for testing.</content>

`environment` - Use `debug` environment for debug builds and `release` for release and TestFlight builds.

`crypto` - CryptoProvider is a protocol, you are required to provide an implementation of `recoverPubKey` and `keccak256` methods.

Account login
-------------

In order to register account in Notify API to be able to subscribe to any dapp to start receiving notifications, account needs to sign SIWE message to prove ownership. Developers can check if an account is registered by calling **`isRegistered()`** function. If the account is not registered, developers should call **`prepareRegistration()`** and then **`register()`** function to register the account.

To login to manage notifications, you must request message to sign with `prepareRegistration()` method and register signature with `register()` method. Once logged in, cross-device syncing will be enabled.

*   `account` - An CAIP-10 account that the identity key will be issued for
*   `domain` - A domain of your wallet, you should use your bundle ID

Provide your own sign function implementation that returns CacaoSignature. If SIWE is not implemented on your app you can always use our [MessageSignerFactory](https://github.com/reown-com/reown-swift/blob/main/Sources/WalletConnectSigner/Signer/MessageSignerFactory.swift) and [DefaultSignerFactory](https://github.com/reown-com/reown-swift/blob/main/Example/Shared/DefaultSignerFactory.swift) from our sample app that uses Web3 SPM package.

Subscribing to a new dapp
-------------------------

To begin receiving notifications from a dapp, users must opt-in by subscribing. This subscription process grants permission for the dapp to send notifications to the user. These notifications can serve a variety of purposes, such as providing updates on the user’s blockchain account activities or informing them about ongoing campaigns within the dapp. Upon initial subscription, clients will be automatically enrolled to receive all types of notifications as defined by the dapp at that moment. Users have the flexibility to modify their notification settings later, allowing them to tailor the types of alerts they receive according to their preferences.

`appDomain` - dapp domain fetched from WalletConnect explorer

`account` - an account you want to associate a subscription with

#### Combine event

Fetching active subscriptions
-----------------------------

To fetch the current list of subscriptions an account has, call **`getActiveSubscriptions()`**.

Method will return an array of NotifySubscription objects that indicates actual subscriptions state

`account` - subscriptions owner account

Fetching subscription’s notifications
-------------------------------------

To fetch subscription’s notifications by calling **`getNotificationHistory()`**.

Method will return an array of NotifyMessageRecord objects that indicates current notify messages state. This do not include old messages that aren’t loaded yet. Useful for displaying initial notifications view state. For more info about pagination, check `fetchHistory` method.

Use this method together with:

*   `messagesPublisher(topic: String)`
*   `fetchHistory`

`topic` - unique subscription’s topic

#### Combine events

Publisher that send messages update event for specific topic only

Publisher that send event on every messages update (for all subscriptions)

Updating subscriptions notification settings
--------------------------------------------

Users can alter their notification settings to filter out unwanted alerts from a dapp. During this process, they review and select the types of notifications they wish to receive, based on the latest options provided by the dapp.

`topic` - topic of the subscription to update

`scope` - The new space delimited list of scopes

Unsubscribe from a dapp
-----------------------

To opt-out of receiving notifications from a dap, a user can decide to unsubscribe from dapp.

`topic` - subscription’s topic

Account logout
--------------

If an account is removed from the client or a user no longer wants to receive notifications for this account, you can logout the account from Notify API by calling **`unregister()`**. This will remove all subscriptions and messages for this account from the client’s storage.

`account` - account ot unregister

Method that fetches notification history and saves it to SDK’s database. When async method finishes execution, `messagesPublisher(topic: String)` will send the event with actual Notify messages for the specified topic.

`subscription` - subscription for which notification history is requested `after?` - id of last notification loaded. Recent notifications will be loaded if provided nil `limit` - notifications to load count

`Returns` - Returns True if there are still not fetched notifications

  <title>Spam Protection - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/ios/notifications/notify/spam-protection</url>
  <content>Users play a critical role in web3. That’s why, with Web3Inbox, we’re committed to ensuring users can enjoy a safe, seamless, and reliable experience that puts them in the driver’s seat. As part of that pledge, Web3Inbox provides a number of user-first, anti-spam features and elements that ensure users are always in control of their web3 communications.

How are users protected from spam with Web3Inbox?
-------------------------------------------------

### Becoming a Web3Inbox customer

When a wallet offers app notifications to their users via Web3Inbox, the feature will always be optional. If users decide they want to receive notifications from selected apps via their wallet, they’ll be able to ‘opt-in’ and subscribe to an app’s notifications by signing a message request. Similarly, when accessing notifications through the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/), users will be met with the same request for each application they choose to subscribe to. This feature not only enables users to experience a customized, ‘app-by-app’ approach to staying connected in web3, but also ensures they only ever hear from the apps they choose to — no unsolicited notifications or spam from unknown senders. Its their curated inbox, connected with only those they choose.

### Setting customized notification preferences

Once users have subscribed to their chosen apps, they have the option to define and set which types of notifications they receive from those apps. For example, a user may wish to receive only information regarding changes to their portfolio from a DEX, or, they might want to receive notifications from an NFT marketplace — but only notifications regarding their own NFT collections. In these scenarios, they’ll have the ability to disable other notification types, like marketing updates, and ensure their feed is curated to show only information that’s meaningful to them. As apps set their own notification types, they have unlimited optionality to really build out a notification structure they know can support their users’ needs — no ‘one size fits all’ approach, but a personable, community-oriented structure that puts both app and user needs’ at the forefront of communication.

### Rate limiting

Apps are limited to a maximum number of notifications they’re able to send to their community. Specifically, apps may send accounts notifications twice an hour on average, but may exceed that average in bursts of up to 50 at a time.

Our continued pledge on spam protection
---------------------------------------

We’re constantly working on improving and growing our products, and we have a number of impactful anti-spam features and functions in the works set to increase the overall protection and user experience of Web3Inbox users:

### User reporting

Users will have the ability to report applications that appear to be acting or engaging with their community in a malicious or suspicious manner. Projects that are flagged as malicious may be removed from the Web3Inbox discover page and have notification functionality disabled.</content>

  <title>SIWX Custom - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/javascript/core/siwx-custom</url>
  <content>SIWX Custom Usage
-----------------

Alternatively from the [Default Implementation](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/javascript/core/siwx-default), you can create your own implementation of the **SIWX** feature to suit your specific requirements.

**SIWX** is developed to work as a plugin system for AppKit and to enable correctly it you need to fulfill the expected interface within the `createAppKit` function.

SIWXConfig interface
--------------------

This is the interface that you need to implement to create your own **SIWX** feature.

All the typings used are exposed by `@reown/appkit-core` package. You may check the source code [here](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/blob/main/packages/core/src/utils/SIWXUtil.ts).

Constraints
-----------

You are able to implement the `SIWXConfig` in the way you would like, but some constraints MUST be followed to make sure that AppKit can interact with it correctly and it will work as expected:

### `createMessage`

This method will be called to create a new message to be signed by the user.

*   The message MUST be unique and contain all the necessary information to verify the user’s identity.

### `addSession`

This method will be called to store a new single session.

*   This method MUST verify if the session is valid and store it in the storage successfully.

### `revokeSession`

This method will be called to revoke all the sessions stored for a specific chain and address.

*   This method MUST delete all the sessions stored for the specific chain and address successfully.

### `setSessions`

This method will be called to replace all the sessions in the storage with the new ones.

*   This method MUST verify all the sessions before storing them in the storage;
*   This method MUST replace all the sessions in the storage with the new ones successfully otherwise it MUST throw an error.

### `getSessions`

This method will be called to get all the sessions stored for a specific chain and address.

*   This method MUST return only sessions that are verified and valid;
*   This method MUST NOT return expired sessions.

  <title>SIWX Default - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/javascript/core/siwx-default</url>
  <content>SIWX Default Usage
------------------

The Sign In With X feature enables decentralized applications (Dapps) to authenticate users seamlessly across multiple blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, Polygon or Solana. The user can connect and then sign a message with their account to prove ownership of the account.

Quick Start
-----------

Here is a quick guide to get started with the **SIWX** feature using the default implementation.

### Example

[

Next.js MultiChain SIWX Default Example
---------------------------------------

Check the Next.js example using DefaultSIWX in a multi-chain environment



](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit-web-examples/blob/main/nextjs/next-siwx-multichain/)

### Installation

### Usage

You should now have the **SIWX** feature up and running in your Dapp.

The `DefaultSIWX` configuration will use the predefined components to handle the message generation, verification and storage of the sessions. You can customize the default implementation by providing your own components as in the following sections.

Customizing the Default Implementation
--------------------------------------

The default implementation of **SIWX** is divided in three main components: `SIWXMessenger`, `SIWXVerifier` and `SIWXStorage`. The `@reown/appkit-siwx` package have defined options to fulfill the parts when initializing the `DefaultSIWX` configuration and you are also able to setup your own parts as required.

### Predefined Components

The `@reown/appkit-siwx` package provides some predefined components that you can use to quickly setup the `DefaultSIWX` configuration.

Check the latest components over the [SIWX repository](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/tree/main/packages/siwx)

#### Customizing components

You may provide the parts to the `DefaultSIWX` configuration using the predefined components exposed by `@reown/appkit-siwx` package and customize the component params as needed.

### Custom Components

You may create your own components to handle the message generation, verification and storage of the sessions. The following sections will guide you through the process of creating your own components.

#### `SIWXMessenger`

The [`SIWXMessenger`](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/blob/main/packages/siwx/src/core/SIWXMessenger.ts) is an abstract class which holds methods for generating the message to be signed.

##### Creating a Custom Messenger:

You may extend the `SIWXMessenger` class adding the public attributes:

*   `version`: a string that represents the version of the messenger;
*   `stringify`: a method that receives the message data and returns a string to be signed.

#### `SIWXVerifier`

The [`SIWXVerifier`](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/blob/main/packages/siwx/src/core/SIWXVerifier.ts) is an abstract class that defines the verification logic for the signed message.

##### Creating a Custom Verifier:

You may extend the `SIWXVerifier` class adding the public attributes:

*   `chainNamespace`: a string that represents the chain namespace for the verifier;
*   `verify`: a method that receives the session data and returns a boolean indicating if the session is valid.

#### `SIWXStorage`

[

Next.js SIWX Default Example with supabase storage
--------------------------------------------------

Check the Next.js example using DefaultSIWX and supabase as default storage



](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit-web-examples/tree/main/nextjs/next-siwx-multichain-supabase-storage)

[`SIWXStorage`](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/blob/main/packages/siwx/src/core/SIWXStorage.ts) is a interface that defines how the session data will be stored.

##### Creating a Custom Storage:

You may implement the `SIWXStorage` interface with the following methods:

*   `add`: This method will be called to store a new single session that is verified;
*   `set`: This method must replace all the sessions in the storage with the new ones;
*   `get`: This method must return all the sessions stored for a specific chain and address. Is expected that the sessions are already verified;
*   `delete`: This method must delete all the sessions stored for a specific chain and address.

#### Using custom components

You may provide your custom components to the `DefaultSIWX` configuration.

If you omit any of the components, the default implementation will be used. Check [here](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/blob/main/packages/siwx/src/configs/DefaultSIWX.ts) the default components.</content>

  <title>Signing the message: “I further authorize this app to view and manage my notifications for ALL apps” - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react-native/notifications/authorization-signatures/all-apps</url>
  <content>When subscribing to notifications from an app that uses Web3Inbox, you may be presented with a signature request that reads the following message:

> I further authorize this app to view and manage my notifications for ALL apps. Read more at [https://walletconnect.com/notifications-all-apps](https://walletconnect.com/notifications-all-apps)

For any signature request, it’s critical that you always read the message attached before signing in order to fully understand the permissions you’re granting.

Take caution when signing this request as doing so will allow the app to:

*   Subscribe you to notifications from any app
*   Manage your notifications for any app
*   View your notifications from any app

The app will not be able to:

*   Sign blockchain transactions or additional messages

Typically, apps you subscribe to for notifications will send a slightly [different request](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react-native/notifications/authorization-signatures/this-app) that asks you to only authorize them to manage notifications _for that app only_ upon signing. You should only ever be presented with the message shown in the example above when an app requires wider access to your subscriptions and messages.

A common example of this would be an app that enables you to view notifications and messages from multiple apps, like a wallet or the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/).

Always be cautious when granting this permission to an app, and ensure that you’re familiar with the app sending the request.

  <title>Usage - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react-native/notifications/frontend-integration/usage</url>
  <content>AppKit Notifications provides you the building blocks necessary to allow users to subscribe, receive notifications, and manage notification preferences, all from your app’s UI. The Web3Inbox SDK supports both React hooks and JavaScript-based integrations.

Before begin using Web3Inbox, you will first need to [setup your project](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react-native/notifications/cloud-setup) to send notifications.

Installation
------------

Example Usage
-------------

This basic example demonstrates how to use the AppKit Notifications to subscribe to notifications and receive them in your app. Refer to the [API Reference](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react-native/notifications/frontend-integration/api) for more details on the available methods.

UX Guidelines
-------------

For the best user experience we have several recommendations on how to build the Web3Inbox flows into your app:

*   Have an explicit opt-in UI to subscribe to notifications. Some users may not want to receive notifications, and enabling notifications requires the user to sign a message with their blockchain account. Enabling notifications should be optional, and if they do enable them they should be told that they will need to sign a message to enable this.
*   Have a button to unsubscribe from notifications once they are enabled. Users may want to stop receiving notifications, so you should have a button to unsubscribe from notifications if the user wants to.
*   Make use of [notification types](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react-native/notifications/cloud-setup#notification-types). These allow the user fine-grained control over what types of notifications they want to receive from your app. These allow users to only unsubscribe from the specific notifications they are no longer interested in, rather than needing to unsubscribe from your entire app. Your app should include functionality to manage notification preferences.

  <title>Spam Protection - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/react-native/notifications/notify/spam-protection</url>
  <content>Users play a critical role in web3. That’s why, with Web3Inbox, we’re committed to ensuring users can enjoy a safe, seamless, and reliable experience that puts them in the driver’s seat. As part of that pledge, Web3Inbox provides a number of user-first, anti-spam features and elements that ensure users are always in control of their web3 communications.

How are users protected from spam with Web3Inbox?
-------------------------------------------------

### Becoming a WalletKit Notification customer

When a wallet offers app notifications to their users via Web3Inbox, the feature will always be optional. If users decide they want to receive notifications from selected apps via their wallet, they’ll be able to ‘opt-in’ and subscribe to an app’s notifications by signing a message request. Similarly, when accessing notifications through the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com/), users will be met with the same request for each application they choose to subscribe to. This feature not only enables users to experience a customized, ‘app-by-app’ approach to staying connected in web3, but also ensures they only ever hear from the apps they choose to — no unsolicited notifications or spam from unknown senders. Its their curated inbox, connected with only those they choose.

### Setting customized notification preferences

Once users have subscribed to their chosen apps, they have the option to define and set which types of notifications they receive from those apps. For example, a user may wish to receive only information regarding changes to their portfolio from a DEX, or, they might want to receive notifications from an NFT marketplace — but only notifications regarding their own NFT collections. In these scenarios, they’ll have the ability to disable other notification types, like marketing updates, and ensure their feed is curated to show only information that’s meaningful to them. As apps set their own notification types, they have unlimited optionality to really build out a notification structure they know can support their users’ needs — no ‘one size fits all’ approach, but a personable, community-oriented structure that puts both app and user needs’ at the forefront of communication.

### Rate limiting

Apps are limited to a maximum number of notifications they’re able to send to their community. Specifically, apps may send accounts notifications twice an hour on average, but may exceed that average in bursts of up to 50 at a time.

Our continued pledge on spam protection
---------------------------------------

We’re constantly working on improving and growing our products, and we have a number of impactful anti-spam features and functions in the works set to increase the overall protection and user experience of WalletKit Notification users:

### User reporting

Users will have the ability to report applications that appear to be acting or engaging with their community in a malicious or suspicious manner. Projects that are flagged as malicious may be removed from the WalletKit Notification discover page and have notification functionality disabled.</content>

Initialization
--------------

#### Initialize the SDK clients

Add listeners for relevant events
---------------------------------

Account login
-------------

In order to register account in Notify API to be able to subscribe to any dapp to start receiving notifications, account needs to sign SIWE message to prove ownership. Developers can check if an account is registered by calling **`isRegistered()`** function. If the account is not registered, developers should call **`prepareRegistration()`** and then **`register()`** function to register the account.

### Registering as a wallet

Subscribing to a new dapp
-------------------------

To begin receiving notifications from a dapp, users must opt-in by subscribing. This subscription process grants permission for the dapp to send notifications to the user. These notifications can serve a variety of purposes, such as providing updates on the user’s blockchain account activities or informing them about ongoing campaigns within the dapp. Upon initial subscription, clients will be automatically enrolled to receive all types of notifications as defined by the dapp at that moment. Users have the flexibility to modify their notification settings later, allowing them to tailor the types of alerts they receive according to their preferences.

Fetching active subscriptions
-----------------------------

To fetch the current list of subscriptions an account has, call **`getActiveSubscriptions()`**.

Fetching subscription’s notifications
-------------------------------------

To fetch subscription’s notifications by calling **`getNotificationHistory()`**.

Fetching available notification types
-------------------------------------

Developers can fetch latest notification types specified by dapp by calling **`getNotificationTypes()`** function.

You can use the `scope` object of the subscription to get the available notification types.

Updating subscriptions notification settings
--------------------------------------------

Users can alter their notification settings to filter out unwanted alerts from a dapp. During this process, they review and select the types of notifications they wish to receive, based on the latest options provided by the dapp. Available notification types fetching is shown in the [next section](https://docs.reown.com/_sites/docs.reown.com/walletkit/react-native/notifications/notify/usage#fetching-available-notification-types).

Unsubscribe from a dapp
-----------------------

To opt-out of receiving notifications from a dap, a user can decide to unsubscribe from dapp.

Account logout
--------------

If an account is removed from the client or a user no longer wants to receive notifications for this account, you can logout the account from Notify API by calling **`unregister()`**. This will remove all subscriptions and messages for this account from the client’s storage.

There might be different approaches to implement pagination in your app depending on your needs. You can see the following example implemented with `FlatList` which introduces infinite scroll functionality with a basic example:

Please make sure you have better handling of the notify client instance which handles worst cases by checking initialization status, account status, for production ready apps.

### Push Notification Setup

Install [`@react-native-firebase/app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-native-firebase/app), [`@react-native-firebase/messaging`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-native-firebase/messaging) and [`@notifee/react-native`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@notifee/react-native) to handle Push Notifications. Please refer to the respective package documentation to configure them properly.

Update your `index.js` file to include the following logic.</content>

  <title>Usage - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/android/notifications/notify/usage</url>
  <content>In this section, we showcase the aspects of using the Notify API. We’ll guide you through the initial steps of initializing the Notify client and logging in a blockchain account. You’ll also learn how to manage your subscriptions and messages. Additionally, we cover the process of setting up and displaying push notifications on your preferred platform. To ensure a good user experience, we include best practices for spam protection, helping you to enable the users to maintain control over the notifications wallet receives.

Initialization
--------------

To initialize the Notify client, create a `Notify.Params.Init` object in the Android Application class with the Core Client passed as a parameter. The `Notify.Params.Init` object will then be passed to the `Notify.initialize` function. There is also an `onError` callback that will need to be provided which will return an instance of `Notify.Model.Error` if there’s an issue initializing the client.

**Note:** The CoreClient used here will be the same instance of the CoreClient used in other WalletConnect Kotlin SDKs

Account login
-------------

In order to register account in Notify API to be able to subscribe to any dapp to start receiving notifications, account needs to sign SIWE message to prove ownership. Developers can check if an account is registered by calling **`isRegistered()`** function. If the account is not registered, developers should call **`prepareRegistration()`** and then **`register()`** function to register the account.

Snippet below shows how to check if an account is registered and how to register an account if it’s not registered yet. Developers could use `CacaoSigner` to sign the message or use their own signing method.

Subscribing to a new dapp
-------------------------

To begin receiving notifications from a dapp, users must opt-in by subscribing. This subscription process grants permission for the dapp to send notifications to the user. These notifications can serve a variety of purposes, such as providing updates on the user’s blockchain account activities or informing them about ongoing campaigns within the dapp. Upon initial subscription, clients will be automatically enrolled to receive all types of notifications as defined by the dapp at that moment. Users have the flexibility to modify their notification settings later, allowing them to tailor the types of alerts they receive according to their preferences.

Fetching active subscriptions
-----------------------------

To fetch the current list of subscriptions an account has, call **`getActiveSubscriptions()`**.

Method will return a map with the topic as the key and `Notify.Model.Subscription` as the value.

Fetching subscription’s notifications
-------------------------------------

To fetch subscription’s notifications by calling **`getNotificationHistory()`**.

Fetching available notification types
-------------------------------------

Developers can fetch latest notification types specified by dapp by calling **`getNotificationTypes()`** function.

Method will return a map with the notification type id as the key and `Notify.Model.NotificationType` as the value.

Updating subscriptions notification settings
--------------------------------------------

Users can alter their notification settings to filter out unwanted alerts from a dapp. During this process, they review and select the types of notifications they wish to receive, based on the latest options provided by the dapp. Available notification types fetching is shown in the [next section](https://docs.reown.com/_sites/docs.reown.com/walletkit/android/notifications/notify/usage#fetching-available-notification-types).

Unsubscribe from a dapp
-----------------------

To opt-out of receiving notifications from a dap, a user can decide to unsubscribe from dapp.

Account logout
--------------

If an account is removed from the client or a user no longer wants to receive notifications for this account, you can logout the account from Notify API by calling **`unregister()`**. This will remove all subscriptions and messages for this account from the client’s storage.

Push Notification best practices
--------------------------------

To create a good user experience and to guide users into unsubscribing from the correct dapp, there are certain best practices when displaying push notifications.

`Core.Model.Message` contains a `type` field, which is a unique id of the notification type. It is recommended to use this field as a notification channel id. By doing so it will create a channel for each notification type. To allow users to granularly control which notifications they want to receive within system settings, it is recommended to create a separate channel for every dapp and every notification type they might have. By doing so user would be able to turn off notifications for specific notification type per every subscribed dapp.

### Firebase Cloud Messaging setup

To setup Firebase Cloud Messaging please follow our [Push Notifications docs](https://docs.reown.com/walletkit/android/notifications/push).

### NotifyClient.Delegate

`NotifyClient` needs a `NotifyClient.Delegate` passed to it for it to be able to expose asynchronous updates sent from the dapp. It’s recommended to set the delegate in the `onCreate` function of the `Application` class.</content>

  <title>Pairing API - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/advanced/api/core/pairing</url>
  <content>The Pairing API is a lightweight API for establishing an encrypted, protocol-agnostic communication layer between peers. Its purpose is to provide a secure channel for proposing protocols or sending requests between dapp and wallet.

Installation
------------

WalletConnect currently offers Sign and Auth SDKs. To allow a reusable communication channel between peers, the Pairing API exposes a standard interface and allows for sending and receiving multi-protocol requests over a single pairing.

Each SDK uses the same implementation of `core/pairing` (via `@walletconnect/core`) to manage pairings. To run multiple SDKs side-by-side (e.g. Sign and Auth), please refer to the \[Sharing a Core instance\] guide.

Usage
-----

The methods listed below are limited to only the public methods of the Pairing API that we recommend you interact with directly. For an exhaustive list, please refer to the spec and/or implementation linked under [Useful Links](https://specs.walletconnect.com/2.0/specs/clients/core/pairing/pairing-methods) above.

The keyword `sdkClient` is used here as a placeholder for any WalletConnect SDK that implements the Pairing API (e.g. `signClient`, `authClient`, etc).

The Pairing API currently emits the following events:

*   `pairing_ping`
*   `pairing_delete`
*   `pairing_expire`

Any of these events can be listened for via the standard Node [`EventEmitter` interface](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#class-eventemitter):

  <title>Introduction - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/advanced/api/sign/overview</url>
  <content>WalletConnect Sign is a remote signer protocol to communicate securely between web3 wallets and dapps. The protocol establishes a remote pairing between two apps and/or devices using a Relay server to relay payloads. These payloads are symmetrically encrypted through a shared key between the two peers. The pairing is initiated by one peer displaying a QR Code or deep link with a standard WalletConnect URI and is established when the counter-party approves this pairing request.

  <title>Dapp Usage - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/advanced/api/sign/dapp-usage</url>
  <content>This library is compatible with Node.js, browsers and React Native applications (Node.js modules require polyfills for React Native).

Dapps will also need to install WalletConnectModal for the UI.

#### Install Packages

Dapps will also need to install `WalletConnectModal` for the UI.

#### Create a Session

**1\. Initiate your WalletConnect client with the relay server, using [your Project ID](https://docs.reown.com/advanced/cloud/relay).**

**2\. Add listeners for desired `SignClient` events.**

**3\. Create a new WalletConnectModal instance.**

**4\. Connect the application and specify session permissions.**

#### Session Authenticate with ReCaps

The authenticate() method enhances the WalletConnect protocol, offering EVM dApps a sophisticated mechanism to request wallet authentication and simultaneously establish a session. This innovative approach not only authenticates the user but also facilitates a seamless session creation, integrating the capabilities defined by ERC-5573, also known as ReCaps.

ReCaps extend the SIWE protocol, enabling users to give informed consent for dApps to exercise scoped capabilities on their behalf. This consent mechanism is crucial for authorizing a dApp to perform actions or access resources, thus ensuring security and trust in dApp interactions. These scoped capabilities are specified through ReCap URIs in the resources field of the AuthRequestParams, which translate to human-readable consent in the SIWE message, detailing the actions a dApp is authorized to undertake.

To initiate an authentication and authorization request, a dApp invokes the authenticate() method, passing in parameters that include desired capabilities as outlined in EIP-5573. The method generates a pairing URI for user interaction, facilitating a streamlined authentication and consent process.

Example of initiating an authentication request with ReCaps:

#### Making Requests

Once the session has been established successfully, you can start making JSON-RPC requests to be approved and signed by the wallet:

> For more information on available JSON-RPC requests, see the [JSON-RPC reference](https://docs.reown.com/advanced/advanced/multichain/rpc-reference/ethereum-rpc.md).

### Restoring a Session

Sessions are saved to localstorage, meaning that even if the web page is reloaded, the session can still be retrieved, as demonstrated in the following code:

#### Finding a Specific Session

  <title>Wallet Usage - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/advanced/api/sign/wallet-usage</url>
  <content>#### Migrating from v1.x

**We recommend you install v1 and v2 together for maximum compatibility.** If your wallet already uses `@walletconnect/client@1.x.x`, you should be able to add `@walletconnect/sign-client@2.x.x` without any issues.

If you experience dependency clashes or you require both `@walletconnect/types@1.x.x` and `@walletconnect/types@2.x.x` in parallel in your wallet’s top-level dependencies, please refer to the [`legacy` packages](https://github.com/WalletConnect/walletconnect-legacy/tree/main/packages) which were published explicitly for this purpose.

In the above scenario, you would replace `@walletconnect/types@1.x.x` with `@walletconnect/legacy-types` and then install `@walletconnect/types@2.x.x`.

#### Initializing the client

Initialize client as a controller using [your Project ID](https://docs.reown.com/advanced/cloud/relay).

#### Setting up event listeners

WalletConnect v2.0 emits events related to the current session. The listeners listed in the following code snippet represent typical events in a session’s lifecycle that you can listen for to synchronise your application accordingly.

Example: when a `session_delete` event is emitted, it makes sense to change the UI from an active session state to an inactive/disconnected state.

**1\. Add listeners for desired `SignClient` events.**

Pairing and session permissions
-------------------------------

#### URI

The pairing proposal between a wallet and a dapp is made using an [URI](https://specs.walletconnect.com/2.0/specs/clients/core/pairing/). In WalletConnect v2.0 the session and pairing are decoupled from each other. This means that a URI is shared to construct a pairing proposal, and only after settling the pairing the dapp can propose a session using that pairing. In simpler words, the dapp generates an URI that can be used by the wallet for pairing.

#### Namespaces

The `namespaces` parameter is used to specify the namespaces and chains that are intended to be used in the session. The following is an example:

#### Pairing with `uri`

To create a pairing proposal, simply pass the `uri` received from the dapp into the `signClient.core.pairing.pair()` function.

#### Pairing with QR Codes

To facilitate better user experience, it is possible to pair wallets with dapps by scanning QR codes. This can be implemented by using any QR code scanning library (example, [react-qr-reader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-qr-reader)). After scanning the QR code, pass the obtained `uri` into the `signClient.pair()` function. A useful reference for implementing QR codes for pairing is the [react wallet example](https://github.com/WalletConnect/web-examples/blob/main/advanced/wallets/react-wallet-v2/).

Authenticated Session
---------------------

This section outlines an innovative protocol method that facilitates the initiation of a Sign session and the authentication of a wallet through a Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE) message, enhanced by ReCaps (ReCap Capabilities). This enhancement not only offers immediate authentication for dApps, paving the way for prompt user logins, but also integrates informed consent for authorization. Through this mechanism, dApps can request the delegation of specific capabilities to perform actions on behalf of the wallet user. These capabilities, encapsulated within SIWE messages as ReCap URIs, detail the scope of actions authorized by the user in an explicit and human-readable form.

By incorporating ReCaps, this method extends the utility of SIWE messages, allowing dApps to combine authentication with a nuanced authorization model. This model specifies the actions a dApp is authorized to execute on the user’s behalf, enhancing security and user autonomy by providing clear consent for each delegated capability. As a result, dApps can utilize these consent-backed messages to perform predetermined actions, significantly enriching the interaction between dApps, wallets, and users within the Ethereum ecosystem.

#### Handling Authentication Requests

To handle incoming authentication requests, subscribe to the `session_authenticate` event. This will notify you of any authentication requests that need to be processed, allowing you to either approve or reject them based on your application logic.

#### Populate Authentication Payload

#### Approving Authentication Requests

#### Rejecting Authentication Requests

If the authentication request cannot be approved or if the user chooses to reject it, use the rejectSession method.</content>

  <title>Dapp Integration Guide - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/advanced/multichain/polkadot/dapp-integration-guide</url>
  <content>Dapp Guide Section Topics
-------------------------

*   WalletConnect Code/Component Setup
*   Constructing unsigned transactions
*   Sending unsigned transactions for signing using WalletConnect
*   Adding the signature to the ExtrinsicPayload
*   Signing and sending the transaction to the node

* * *

WalletConnect Code/Component Setup
----------------------------------

1.  **One time step**: Generate a unique `projectId` by visiting and creating your project’s profile on WalletConnect’s project dashboard at: [https://cloud.reown.com/](https://cloud.reown.com/).
    
2.  Import `UniversalProvider` and `{ WalletConnectModal }` from `@walletconnect/universal-provider` and `@walletconnect/modal` respectively.
    

3.  Instantiate a universal provider using the `projectId` created for your app.

4.  On user action (e.g. user clicks connect for WalletConnect), call the connect method on the providers sign client passing in preferred params.

WalletConnect uses chain ids based on the CAIP standard (CAIP-13 for Polkadot Namespace): [Polkadot WalletConnect CAIP-13](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-13.md)

*   polkadot CAIP id = `91b171bb158e2d3848fa23a9f1c25182`
    
*   kusama CAIP id = `b0a8d493285c2df73290dfb7e61f870f`
    
*   westend CAIP id = `e143f23803ac50e8f6f8e62695d1ce9e`
    
*   statemint CAIP id = `68d56f15f85d3136970ec16946040bc1`
    
*   hydradx CAIP id = `afdc188f45c71dacbaa0b62e16a91f72`
    
*   phala network CAIP id = `1bb969d85965e4bb5a651abbedf21a54`
    
*   astar network CAIP id = `9eb76c5184c4ab8679d2d5d819fdf90b`
    
*   crust shadow CAIP id = `d4c0c08ca49dc7c680c3dac71a7c0703`
    
*   mangata kusama mainnet CAIP id = `d611f22d291c5b7b69f1e105cca03352`
    
*   turing network CAIP id = `0f62b701fb12d02237a33b84818c11f6`
    
*   Chain ids correspond to the genesis hash for each respective chain
    

### Example Namespace and Sign Client connect call:

**Note**: this serves as an example where a dapp requires 3 different chain namespaces (polkadot, hydradx and turing network). The supported methods, chains, and events can all be defined by the dapp team based on the requirements of the dapp.

5.  Create a standalone modal using your dapps WalletConnect projectId.

6.  Open the modal prompting the user to scan the QR code with their wallet app or copy the URI from the modal and paste into their wallet app to begin the session creation process.

7.  Get the accounts from the session for use in constructing transactions.

Constructing Unsigned Transactions
----------------------------------

One thing the dapp must do is properly construct the unsigned transaction. This consists of constructing an object with the intended chain’s metadata including the `specVersion`, `transactionVersion`, etc. In addition to these, you must provide the transaction data (`method`, `address` etc). Below is an example of what this general structure looks like using polkadotjs but this can be done in any valid way:

8.  A specific example of constructing an unsigned transaction using polkadotjs api to retrieve the chains metadata.

Sending unsigned transactions to the wallet for signing using WalletConnect
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.  Send the unsigned transaction to the paired wallet for signing using the providers sign client. This triggers a `session_request` event which must be handled by the paired wallet.

### Polkadot Example

### Parachain Example (HydraDX)

Once the request is resolved, the expected response should be a result object which contains a signature

Adding the signature to the ExtrinsicPayload
--------------------------------------------

Using this signature, we can now create an `ExtrinsicPayload` and add the signature. Below is an example of this general step:

Signing and sending the transaction to the node
-----------------------------------------------

Now, it is just about attaching the returned signature to the transaction and submitting it as specified by the dApp. Below is a specific example showing this process:</content>

  <content>Initialization
--------------

To setup the client you need to configure it with your `projectId` which you can obtain from [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/).

Furthermore you may need to configure the `domain` and `isLimited` parameters:

*   `domain` defaults to `window.location.host` and must be set to the domain setup in Cloud Setup. For example `app.example.com`. Do not add the scheme (`https://`).
*   `allApps` determines if your app has access to all of the user’s subscriptions, or only the ones that the app is hosted on. By setting it to `true`, it enables setting `domain` to a value other than `window.location.host`. Setting `allApps: true` can be useful during development to allow your localhost-deployed app to access the subscriptions for the domain you setup. Note that most apps do not need to set this in production environments, as they only need access to their own subscriptions. When enabled, the user has to sign a SIWE message granting your app more permissions, and this requires additional consideration from the user.

#### References

*   **projectId:** Your WalletConnect project ID
*   **domain _(Optional)_:** Your app’s domain. Defaults to `window.location.host`.
*   **allApps _(Optional)_:** Set to `true` to request access to all of the user’s notification subscriptions for all apps, instead of only `domain`. Defaults to `false`.
*   **logLevel _(Optional)_:** Increase verbosity of console logging. Defaults to `error`. Can be set to `error`, `info`, or `debug`.

Registering for Device Push Notifications
-----------------------------------------

If you wish to receive live push notifications to your React Native or Web app, you must integrate with Firebase Messaging. More information about how to integrate with Firebase can be found [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging).

Your integration will obtain a token from Firebase and you will need to pass this token to the Web3Inbox SDK using the `registerWithPushServer()` function.

#### References

*   `registerWithPushServer`: `(token: string, platform: 'fcm' | 'apns' = 'fcm') => void`

Either APNs or FCM can be used to receive push notifications to the device. The `token` you provide may be a token from either platform, provided the `platform` argument matches.

Listening For Events
--------------------

This can be used to listen to, for example, messages received in realtime.

Setting `allApps: true` can be useful during development to allow your localhost-deployed app to access the subscriptions for the domain you setup. Note that most apps do not need to set this in production environments, as they only need access to their own subscriptions. When enabled, the user has to sign a SIWE message granting your app more permissions, and this requires additional consideration from the user.

#### References

*   **projectId:** Your WalletConnect project ID
*   **domain _(Optional)_:** Your app’s domain. Defaults to `window.location.host`.
*   **allApps _(Optional)_:** Set to `true` to request access to all of the user’s notification subscriptions for all apps, instead of only `domain`. Defaults to `false`.

Registering for Device Push Notifications
-----------------------------------------

If you wish to receive live push notifications to your React Native or Web app, you must integrate with Firebase Messaging. More information about how to integrate with Firebase can be found [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging).

Your integration will obtain a token from Firebase and you will need to pass this token to the Web3Inbox SDK using the `registerWithPushServer()` function.

#### References

*   `registerWithPushServer`: `(token: string, platform: 'fcm' | 'apns' = 'fcm') => void`

Either APNs or FCM can be used to receive push notifications to the device. The `token` you provide may be a token from either platform, provided the `platform` argument matches.

Listening For Events
--------------------

This can be used to listen to, for example, messages received in realtime.

  <title>Shared Core Instance - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/advanced/api/core/shared-core</url>
  <content>WalletConnect’s SDKs are designed to share common logic and resources via the `@walletconnect/core` package.

**If you intend to leverage multiple SDKs together (e.g. Sign + Auth), it is highly recommended to instantiate a single `Core` instance and pass it to the relevant SDKs.** This avoids each SDK creating its own `Core` instance, and thus duplicating computation, memory allocation, event listeners etc.

In the following example, we first instantiate a `Core` instance, and then proceed to instantiate both the Sign and Auth SDK with this shared `Core`:</content>

  <content>Initialization
--------------

To setup the client you need to configure it with your `projectId` which you can obtain from [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/).

Furthermore you may need to configure the `domain` and `isLimited` parameters:

*   `domain` defaults to `window.location.host` and must be set to the domain setup in Cloud Setup. For example `app.example.com`. Do not add the scheme (`https://`).
*   `allApps` determines if your app has access to all of the user’s subscriptions, or only the ones that the app is hosted on. By setting it to `true`, it enables setting `domain` to a value other than `window.location.host`. Setting `allApps: true` can be useful during development to allow your localhost-deployed app to access the subscriptions for the domain you setup. Note that most apps do not need to set this in production environments, as they only need access to their own subscriptions. When enabled, the user has to sign a SIWE message granting your app more permissions, and this requires additional consideration from the user.

#### References

*   **projectId:** Your WalletConnect project ID
*   **domain _(Optional)_:** Your app’s domain. Defaults to `window.location.host`.

  <title>Signing the message: “I further authorize this app to send me notifications” - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/notifications/authorization-signatures/this-app</url>
  <content>When subscribing to notifications from an app that uses Web3Inbox, you’ll likely be presented with a signature request that reads the following message:

> I further authorize this app to send me notifications. Read more at [https://walletconnect.com/notifications](https://walletconnect.com/notifications)

For any signature request, it’s critical that you always read the message attached before signing to fully understand the permissions you’re granting.

By signing this request, you’re allowing the app to:

*   Subscribe you to notifications from only this app
*   Manage your notifications for only this app
*   View your notifications from only this app

The app will not be able to:

*   Sign blockchain transactions or additional messages
*   Subscribe to, manage, or view notifications from other apps

Most apps that send notifications using Web3Inbox will request for you to sign this message—this will allow the app to simply interact with you directly. If you wish to opt-in to receive notifications from this app, signing this message will enable you to do so.

If you’ve signed up to notifications but have received a different message, head [here](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/notifications/authorization-signatures/all-apps) to learn about other scenarios in which you may receive a signature request regarding notifications.

  <title>Pairing API - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/advanced/api/core//pairing</url>
  <content>The Pairing API is a lightweight API for establishing an encrypted, protocol-agnostic communication layer between peers. Its purpose is to provide a secure channel for proposing protocols or sending requests between dapp and wallet.

Installation
------------

WalletConnect currently offers Sign and Auth SDKs. To allow a reusable communication channel between peers, the Pairing API exposes a standard interface and allows for sending and receiving multi-protocol requests over a single pairing.

Each SDK uses the same implementation of `core/pairing` (via `@walletconnect/core`) to manage pairings. To run multiple SDKs side-by-side (e.g. Sign and Auth), please refer to the \[Sharing a Core instance\] guide.

Usage
-----

The methods listed below are limited to only the public methods of the Pairing API that we recommend you interact with directly. For an exhaustive list, please refer to the spec and/or implementation linked under [Useful Links](https://specs.walletconnect.com/2.0/specs/clients/core/pairing/pairing-methods) above.

The keyword `sdkClient` is used here as a placeholder for any WalletConnect SDK that implements the Pairing API (e.g. `signClient`, `authClient`, etc).

The Pairing API currently emits the following events:

*   `pairing_ping`
*   `pairing_delete`
*   `pairing_expire`

Any of these events can be listened for via the standard Node [`EventEmitter` interface](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#class-eventemitter):

*   [Using Namespaces with the Universal Provider](https://docs.reown.com/_sites/docs.reown.com/advanced/multichain/polkadot/namespaces-guide#dapps-universal-provider-and-namespaces)
*   [Using Namespaces with the WalletKit](https://docs.reown.com/_sites/docs.reown.com/advanced/multichain/polkadot/namespaces-guide#wallets-walletkit-and-namespaces)

### Understanding Namespaces

*   Pairing sessions use specific methods, events and chains during their lifetimes. These arguments constitute what is known as a `namespace`.
*   Namespaces are used to specify the chains, methods and events that are intended to be used in a particular session.
*   They establish the minimal requirement for a wallet and a dapp to get paired. There are two types of namespaces, `proposal namespaces` and `session namespaces`.

### Proposal Namespaces

*   A dapp sends a proposal namespace to the wallet for pairing. The proposal namespace contains the list of `chains`, `methods` and `events` that the dapp intends to make use of.
*   The wallet validates if the received proposal namespaces are valid and returns a session with its approved namespaces as a response if it is valid along with the approved accounts for each chain in the namespace.
*   If the requested proposal namespaces are not valid based on the wallets rules, the session cannot be established and the wallet rejects it with an error code that tells the dapp if the proposal namespaces have invalid chains, methods, events or if it was simply rejected by the user.

### Proposal Namespace Example

An example Proposal Namespace for a dapp which supports connecting to Polkadot, Ethereum, Polygon and Cosmos:

### Session Namespaces

*   The wallet validates if the received proposal namespaces match with the session namespaces it supports. If they match, a session is established successfully and pairing is completed. If not, the session is not established.
*   The wallet session can also choose to provide access to more chains, methods or events that were not a part of the proposal namespaces. This means a dapp could send a proposal namespace with only Polkadot `['polkadot:91b171bb158e2d3848fa23a9f1c25182']` in its requiredNamespaces `chains` field but a wallet could return a session namespace with both Polkadot and Kusama `['polkadot:91b171bb158e2d3848fa23a9f1c25182','polkadot:b0a8d493285c2df73290dfb7e61f870f']` as part of the sessions namespaces.

### Session Namespace Example

### Chains

*   `chains` is an array of chain ids which represent the chains the session will be using during its lifetime. For Polkadot, the format for each chain id is the chain agnostic namespace (e.g. `eip155`, `polkadot`, `cosmos` etc) followed by a colon and the genesis hash for the chain (e.g. `91b171bb158e2d3848fa23a9f1c25182` for Polkadot).
*   A dapp or wallet can make as many or as few chain ids a part of its namespace as desired.

### Methods

*   `methods` is represented as an array of wallet defined methods that a session supports.
*   These are not pre-defined or centrally implemented and can be modified/extended as needed by a wallet.
*   In the above Polkadot session namespace example there are two given methods `polkadot_signMessage` and `polkadot_signTransaction`. The idea for the functionality of these methods is to sign the relevant data (either a message or unsigned transaction) and return the signature. [An example for each method](https://github.com/WalletConnect/web-examples/blob/main/advanced/wallets/react-wallet-v2/src/lib/PolkadotLib.ts).
*   If a dapp required additional method support such as receiving the signed hex for a transaction in order to submit it rather than the signature, a wallet only needs to define and add support for the method so that any dapp that requires that functionality can use it when making requests.
*   An example would be adding a method named `polkadot_getSignedHex` and creating an implementation that signs, and returns the hash of the signed transaction.

*   Wallets and dapps can define an agreed upon interface based on a particular chain or ecosystems needs.

### Events

*   `events` represent specific changes in a sessions state that a dapp or wallet may want to take some action on.
*   For example, a dapp or a wallet might want to perform some action if the user changes the selected session accounts. An example of emitting this event can be found below:

This can be useful in a wallet if a user is adding additional accounts to a session so that the wallet or dapp can respond and update their respective states using events such as `session_update` to update the accounts, chains, methods or events for the session or `session_delete` to end a session. [(More on events)](https://docs.walletconnect.com/specs/clients/sign/session-events#session_request).

### Using Namespaces

In order to create a session proposal, call the connect method on the universal provider’s sign client. The sign clients `connect` method accepts an object based on the following interface:

### Dapps: Universal Provider and Namespaces:

The connect method on the universal provider expects an object that matches the above `ConnectParams` interface. All fields are optional and in the below example we use only the `requiredNamespaces` field in our proposal namespace:

### Wallets: WalletKit and Namespaces:

When the WalletKit approves and creates a session, it must provide the session proposal `id` as well as the session `namespaces` which are approved for use in the session. An example of what this looks like is below.

More information on namespaces can be found [here](https://docs.walletconnect.com/specs/clients/sign/namespaces#controller-side-validation-of-incoming-proposal-namespaces-wallet).</content>

The QRModal is enabled by default on reown’s AppKit. In order to use it, all you need to do is to create an AppKit instance.

### Installation

### Setup

Upon integrating the below code, you will be able to see the QRModal on your Web3 App.

Use without AppKit
------------------

You can subscribe to the `display_uri` event and handle the URI yourself.

You can then use the URI to generate a QR Code or redirect the user from the mobile browser to the wallet and request to connect. The later one will require you to use the wallet’s deep link and the URI. You can get the deep link of wallets that support the WalletConnect v2 protocol from the [Explorer API](https://docs.reown.com/cloud/explorer.md).

Sending Requests
----------------

Events
------

Session data
------------

Once a wallet is connected you can find the session data in the `provider.session` object.

The session object includes the following properties, _among others_:

*   **namespaces**: `session.namespaces` is an object that contains the approved session data.

*   **requiredNamespaces, optionalNamespaces & sessionProperties**: These objects contain the namespaces and properties proposed for the session.
*   **peer**: The `session.peer.metadata` object contains the metadata of the connected wallet.

Find the complete type definition of the `session` object [here](https://github.com/WalletConnect/walletconnect-monorepo/blob/022e4d492c9862ab9b17c1a7b12884bdcd992ae4/packages/types/src/sign-client/session.ts#L25).</content>

*   Approving a Session Proposal
*   Rejecting a Session Proposal
*   Handling Session Request Events
*   Session Persistence/Management

* * *

1.  **Getting Started:** Generate a unique `projectId` by visiting and creating your project’s profile on WalletConnect’s project dashboard at:
    *   `https://cloud.reown.com/`

WalletConnect Code/Component Setup
----------------------------------

2.  Import Core and WalletKit from WalletConnect.

3.  Instantiate and add Core and WalletKit to the state of the wallet.

4.  Create a function to accept a session `uri` which will be passed from a dapp when a user either scans the dapp’s WalletConnect qrcode modal or manually copies and pastes the uri from the modal into the wallet’s UI.

5.  Handle the `session_proposal` event on the `walletKit`. This event is triggered when the `pair` method is called on `walletKit.core.pairing` to create a pairing session.

Approving a Session Proposal (Example)
--------------------------------------

When approving a session proposal, the wallet can perform any necessary checks such as ensuring that the proposal includes all required namespaces and any optional namespaces. The approval response also contains the approved accounts as part of the namespace. Below is an example showing the format for wallet accounts and how to include them in a session proposal approval.

Rejecting a Session Proposal (Example)
--------------------------------------

If the user does not approve the requested chains, methods, or accounts, or if the wallet does not support the requested chains or methods, the response should not be considered a success. Below is an example of rejecting a session proposal.

Handling Session Request Event
------------------------------

A dapp triggers an event when it requires the wallet to carry out a specific action, such as signing a transaction. The event includes a topic and a request object, which will differ based on the requested action. As seen in the [WalletConnect Web Examples](https://github.com/WalletConnect/web-examples/blob/main/advanced/wallets/react-wallet-v2/src/lib/PolkadotLib.ts), two common use cases in polkadot are signing messages and signing transactions. These methods are represented here as `polkadot_signMessage` and `polkadot_signTransaction` respectively and each simply signs the respective payload and returns the signature to the dapp. An example of a `session_request` event handler containing both can be found below.

Sessions Persistence/Management
-------------------------------

*   sessions can be saved/stored so users don’t have to pair repeatedly
*   sessions can be disconnected from using `await walletKit.disconnectSession({ topic: topic });` passing the session topic.
*   sessions can be extended using `await walletKit.extendSession({ topic: topic });` passing the session topic.
*   Default session lifetime is 7 days for WalletConnect v2.0.

  <title>Signing the message: “I further authorize this app to send me notifications” - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react-native/notifications/authorization-signatures/this-app</url>
  <content>When subscribing to notifications from an app that uses Web3Inbox, you’ll likely be presented with a signature request that reads the following message:

> I further authorize this app to send me notifications. Read more at [https://walletconnect.com/notifications](https://walletconnect.com/notifications)

For any signature request, it’s critical that you always read the message attached before signing to fully understand the permissions you’re granting.

By signing this request, you’re allowing the app to:

*   Subscribe you to notifications from only this app
*   Manage your notifications for only this app
*   View your notifications from only this app

The app will not be able to:

*   Sign blockchain transactions or additional messages
*   Subscribe to, manage, or view notifications from other apps

Most apps that send notifications using Web3Inbox will request for you to sign this message—this will allow the app to simply interact with you directly. If you wish to opt-in to receive notifications from this app, signing this message will enable you to do so.

If you’ve signed up to notifications but have received a different message, head [here](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react-native/notifications/authorization-signatures/all-apps) to learn about other scenarios in which you may receive a signature request regarding notifications.

Introduction
------------

AppKit has support for [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) and [Ethers v6](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/) on Ethereum, [@solana/web3.js](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/) on Solana and Bitcoin. Choose one of these to get started.

### AppKit CLI

Reown offers a dedicated CLI to set up a minimal version of AppKit in the easiest and quickest way possible.

To do this, please run the command below.

After running the command, you will be prompted to confirm the installation of the CLI. Upon your confirmation, the CLI will request the following details:

1.  **Project Name**: Enter the name for your project.
2.  **Framework**: Select your preferred framework or library. Currently, you have three options: React, Next.js, and Vue.
3.  **Network-Specific libraries**: Choose whether you want to install Wagmi, Ethers, Solana, or Multichain (EVM + Solana).

After providing the project name and selecting your preferences, the CLI will install a minimal example of AppKit with your preferred blockchain library. The example will be pre-configured with a `projectId` that will only work on `localhost`.

To fully configure your project, please obtain a `projectId` from the Reown Cloud Dashboard and update your project accordingly.

**Refer to [this section](https://docs.reown.com/_sites/docs.reown.com/appkit/vue/core/installation#cloud-configuration) for more information.**

### Custom Installation

Cloud Configuration
-------------------

Create a new project on Reown Cloud at [https://cloud.reown.com](https://cloud.reown.com/) and obtain a new project ID.

Implementation
--------------

[

wagmi Example
-------------

Check the Vue wagmi example



](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit-web-examples/tree/main/vue/vue-wagmi)

For a quick integration, you can use the `createAppKit` function with a unified configuration. This automatically applies the predefined configurations for different adapters like Wagmi, Ethers, or Solana, so you no longer need to manually configure each one individually. Simply pass the common parameters such as `projectId`, `chains`, `metadata`, etc., and the function will handle the adapter-specific configurations under the hood.

This includes WalletConnect, Coinbase and Injected connectors, and the [Blockchain API](https://docs.reown.com/cloud/blockchain-api) as a [transport](https://wagmi.sh/core/api/createConfig#transports)

In your `App.vue` file set up the following configuration

Importing networks
------------------

Reown AppKit use [Viem](https://viem.sh/) networks under the hood, which provide a wide variety of networks for EVM chains. You can find all the networks supported by Viem within the `@reown/appkit/networks` path.

Trigger the modal
-----------------

To open AppKit you can use our [**web component**](https://docs.reown.com/appkit//core/components) or build your own button with AppKit [**composables**](https://docs.reown.com/appkit//core/composables.mdx#useAppKit). In this example we are going to use the `<appkit-button>` component.

Web components are global html elements that don’t require importing.

Learn more about the AppKit web components [here](https://docs.reown.com/appkit//core/components)

Smart Contract Interaction
--------------------------

[Wagmi actions](https://wagmi.sh/core/api/actions/readContract) can help us interact with wallets and smart contracts:

  <title>Flutter - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit//flutter/core/installation</url>
  <content>With AppKit Flutter, you can easily let people interact with multiple EVM compatible wallets and blockchains.

Let’s get started with the installation and configuration!

Installation
------------

1.  *   Add `reown_appkit` as dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` and run `flutter pub get` (check out the [latest version](https://pub.dev/packages/reown_appkit/install))
    *   Or simply run `flutter pub add reown_appkit`
2.  *   Locate your `/ios/Podfile` file and add the following as the first line:

3.  *   Run `$ pod install` inside `/ios` folder.
4.  *   You should now be able to run your app with `flutter run --dart-define=PROJECT_ID={your_project_id}`

### Enable Installed Wallet Detection

To enable AppKit to detect installed wallets on the device, you need to make specific changes to the native sides of the project.

1.  Open your `Info.plist` file.
2.  Locate the `<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>` section.
3.  Add the desired wallet schemes as string entries within the `<array>`. These schemes represent the wallets you want to detect.
4.  Refer to our [Info.plist example file](https://github.com/reown-com/reown_flutter/blob/master/packages/reown_appkit/example/modal/ios/Runner/Info.plist) for a detailed illustration.

Example:

### Coinbase Wallet support

Coinbase Wallet does not use the WalletConnect protocol for communication between the dApp and the wallet.

This means that pairing topic, session topic, session events and other session-related features are not available when connecting to Coinbase Wallet.

However, you can still enable it to seamlessly connect with your dApp with these additional steps.

If you still want to support it, on your iOS and Android native side make the following changes:

1.  Open your `Info.plist` file.
2.  Locate the `<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>` section.
3.  Include `<string>cbwallet</string>` scheme as mentioned above in previous section

Example:

4.  Make sure pods are installed, otherwise run `pod install` inside your `/ios` folder.
5.  Open your `/ios/Runner.xcworkspace` file with Xcode and add the following code in `AppDelegate.swift` file:

Checkout out the [AppDelegate.swift](https://github.com/reown-com/reown_flutter/blob/master/packages/reown_appkit/example/modal/ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift) file from our sample dapp for reference.

#### Disable Coinbase Wallet

Coinbase Wallet is enabled by default even if, in order to function properly, a few steps has to be done as described in the previous section. However, if you don’t want to include/support Coinbase Wallet on your app you just need to pass Coinbase Wallet id `fd20dc426fb37566d803205b19bbc1d4096b248ac04548e3cfb6b3a38bd033aa` to [excludedWalletIds](https://docs.reown.com/appkit//flutter/core/options#excludedwalletids) options Array.

### Phantom Wallet support

Phantom Wallet does not use the WalletConnect protocol for communication between the dApp and the wallet, instead it provides an internal API mechanism based on deep/universal links.

This means that pairing topic, session topic, session events and other session-related features are not available when connecting to Phantom Wallet and the interaction is really basic. Dapp sends a request, Phantom Wallet responds. That’s all.

Furthermore, Phantom Wallet’s deep/universal linking mechanism supports interaction exclusively with the Solana network. This means that if you have EVM networks configured in your AppKit instance, they will not be available for use after connecting with Phantom.

In order to support Phantom Wallet interactions a few extra steps has to be performed (only if you haven’t implemented [Link Mode](https://docs.reown.com/appkit//flutter/core/link-mode) already).

1.  First, be sure you already have your redirection back property configure in your dApp’s metadata. See [Redirect to your dApp](https://docs.reown.com/appkit//flutter/core/usage#redirect-to-your-dapp)
2.  Then you will have to implement your own Deep Link mechanism on Flutter (and native) side so when a link is received through it, you would just call `await _appKitModal.dispatchEnvelope(link);`

As a guidance, here you can see how it’s done in our sample dApp:

##### First, on Flutter side we create an `EventChannel` where links are going to be received and passed to `dispatchEnvelope()`.

##### Then, on both native sides we leverage native APIs to capture the app opening link and send it to Flutter side.

*   [Android’s platform specific code](https://github.com/reown-com/reown_flutter/blob/develop/packages/reown_appkit/example/base/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/example/dapp/MainActivity.kt) (only `eventsChannel` is important Phantom wise)
*   [iOS’s platform specific code](https://github.com/reown-com/reown_flutter/blob/develop/packages/reown_appkit/example/base/ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift) (only `eventsChannel` is important Phantom wise)
*   [Dart’s specific code](https://github.com/reown-com/reown_flutter/blob/develop/packages/reown_appkit/example/base/lib/utils/deep_link_handler.dart) (only `eventsChannel` is important Phantom wise)

_Constructing a Solana transaction would depend on the library/package of your choice but in [_our sample dApp’s code_](https://github.com/reown-com/reown_flutter/blob/develop/packages/reown_appkit/example/base/lib/utils/crypto/helpers.dart#L170) you can see how we do it using `solana_web3` package._

#### Disable Phantom Wallet

Phantom Wallet is enabled by default even if, in order to function properly, a few steps has to be done as described in the previous section. However, if you don’t want to include/support Phantom Wallet on your app you just need to pass Phantom Wallet id `a797aa35c0fadbfc1a53e7f675162ed5226968b44a19ee3d24385c64d1d3c393` to [excludedWalletIds](https://docs.reown.com/appkit//flutter/core/options#excludedwalletids) options Array.

[

wagmi Example
-------------

Check the Next wagmi example



](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit-web-examples/tree/main/nextjs/next-wagmi-app-router)

For a quick integration, you can use the `createAppKit` function with a unified configuration. This automatically applies the predefined configurations for different adapters like Wagmi, Ethers, or Solana, so you no longer need to manually configure each one individually. Simply pass the common parameters such as projectId, chains, metadata, etc., and the function will handle the adapter-specific configurations under the hood.

This includes WalletConnect, Coinbase and Injected connectors, and the [Blockchain API](https://docs.reown.com/cloud/blockchain-api) as a [transport](https://wagmi.sh/core/api/createConfig#transports)

### Wagmi config

Create a new file for your Wagmi configuration, since we are going to be calling this function on the client and the server it cannot live inside a file with the ‘use client’ directive.

For this example we will create a file called `config/index.tsx` outside our app directory and set up the following configuration

Importing networks
------------------

Reown AppKit use [Viem](https://viem.sh/) networks under the hood, which provide a wide variety of networks for EVM chains. You can find all the networks supported by Viem within the `@reown/appkit/networks` path.

SSR and Hydration
-----------------

:::info

*   Using cookies is completely optional and by default Wagmi will use `localStorage` instead if the `storage` param is not defined.
*   The `ssr` flag will delay the hydration of the Wagmi’s store to avoid hydration mismatch errors.
*   AppKit don’t fully support the `ssr` flag. :::

  

### Context Provider

Let’s create now a context provider that will wrap our application and initialized AppKit (`createAppKit` needs to be called inside a Next Client Component file).

In this example we will create a file called `context/index.tsx` outside our app directory and set up the following configuration

### Layout

Next, in our `app/layout.tsx` file, we will import our `ContextProvider` component and call [the Wagmi’s function `cookieToInitialState`.](https://wagmi.sh/react/guides/ssr#_2-hydrate-the-cookie)

The `initialState` returned by `cookieToInitialState`, contains the optimistic values that will populate the Wagmi’s store both on the server and client.

Create a new project on Reown Cloud at [https://cloud.reown.com](https://cloud.reown.com/) and obtain a new project ID.

Implementation
--------------

[

wagmi Example
-------------

Check the Javascript wagmi example



](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit-web-examples/tree/main/javascript/javascript-wagmi)

For a quick integration, you can use the `createAppKit` function with a unified configuration. This automatically applies the predefined configurations for different adapters like Wagmi, Ethers, or Solana, so you no longer need to manually configure each one individually. Simply pass the common parameters such as `projectId`, `chains`, `metadata`, etc., and the function will handle the adapter-specific configurations under the hood.

This includes WalletConnect, Coinbase and Injected connectors, and the [Blockchain API](https://docs.reown.com/cloud/blockchain-api) as a [transport](https://wagmi.sh/core/api/createConfig#transports)

In your `main.js` file set up the following configuration.

Importing networks
------------------

Reown AppKit use [Viem](https://viem.sh/) networks under the hood, which provide a wide variety of networks for EVM chains. You can find all the networks supported by Viem within the `@reown/appkit/networks` path.

Trigger the modal
-----------------

To open AppKit you can use our [**web component**](https://docs.reown.com/appkit//core/components) or build your own button with AppKit [**actions**](https://docs.reown.com/appkit//core/actions.mdx#open-and-close-the-modal). In this example we are going to use the `<appkit-button>` component.

Web components are global html elements that don’t require importing.

Learn more about the AppKit web components [here](https://docs.reown.com/appkit//core/components)

Blockchain Interaction
----------------------

You need to install @wagmi/core to interact with smart contracts:

[Wagmi actions](https://wagmi.sh/core/api/actions/readContract) can help us interact with wallets and smart contracts:

For this use case, we need to import the `wagmiConfig`from our AppKit WagmiAdapter configuration.

Read more about Wagmi actions for smart contract interaction [here](https://wagmi.sh/core/actions/readContract).

1.  Open your `Info.plist` file.
2.  Locate the `<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>` section.
3.  Add the desired wallet schemes as string entries within the `<array>`. These schemes represent the wallets you want to detect.
4.  Refer to our [Info.plist example file](https://github.com/WalletConnect/react-native-examples/blob/main/dapps/ModalUProvider/ios/ModalUProvider/Info.plist) for a detailed illustration.

Example:

Enable Coinbase Wallet
----------------------

Follow these steps to install Coinbase SDK in your project along with our Coinbase package. Check [here](https://mobilewalletprotocol.github.io/wallet-mobile-sdk/docs/client-sdk/rn-install) for more detailed information.

*   Note: Coinbase SDK is [not compatible with Expo Go](https://github.com/MobileWalletProtocol/wallet-mobile-sdk/issues/206)

1.  Enable Expo Modules in your project running:

2.  Install Coinbase SDK

3.  Install our custom connector

`yarn add @reown/appkit-coinbase-wagmi-react-native`

4.  Run pod-install

  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react-native/notifications/frontend-integration/api</url>
  <content>Initialization
--------------

To setup the client you need to configure it with your `projectId` which you can obtain from [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/).

Furthermore you may need to configure the `domain` and `isLimited` parameters:

*   `domain` defaults to `window.location.host` and must be set to the domain setup in Cloud Setup. For example `app.example.com`. Do not add the scheme (`https://`).
*   `allApps` determines if your app has access to all of the user’s subscriptions, or only the ones that the app is hosted on. By setting it to `true`, it enables setting `domain` to a value other than `window.location.host`. Setting `allApps: true` can be useful during development to allow your localhost-deployed app to access the subscriptions for the domain you setup. Note that most apps do not need to set this in production environments, as they only need access to their own subscriptions. When enabled, the user has to sign a SIWE message granting your app more permissions, and this requires additional consideration from the user.

#### References

*   **projectId:** Your WalletConnect project ID
*   **domain _(Optional)_:** Your app’s domain. Defaults to `window.location.host`.
*   **allApps _(Optional)_:** Set to `false` to request access to all of the user’s notification subscriptions for all apps, instead of only `domain`. Defaults to `true`.

Managing Account
----------------

### Setting account for web3inbox

### References

*   **account:** CAIP-10 account currently active in Web3Inbox
*   **setAccount:** Change actively managed account in Web3Inbox
*   **watchAccount:** Watcher ticks whenever the account updates

### Registering an account

**Note**: [EIP-1271 signatures](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271) coming from smart wallets are supported in version `1.1.0` and above.

#### References

*   **prepareRegistration:** Prepare registration params
*   **register:** Register using a signature and register params
*   **getAccountIsRegistered:** Returns if account is registered

Some suggested methods of signing the message:

*   Ethers.js [`Wallet.signMessage` method](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/signer/#Signer-signMessage)
*   `@wagmi/core` [`signMessage` method](https://wagmi.sh/core/api/actions/signMessage)
*   The [`useSignMessage` hook](https://wagmi.sh/react/hooks/useSignMessage) in `@wagmi`

Managing Subscription
---------------------

Subscribe, Unsubscribe, Get Subscription, Check if Subscribed.

#### References

*   **account _(Optional)_:** CAIP-10 account
*   **domain _(Optional)_:** dapp domain
*   **subscription:** _Non-Reactive_ state, returning current subscription information, of type:

*   **subscription:** _Non-Reactive_ state, returning array of current subscriptions

Managing Notifications
----------------------

You can retrieve notifications using pagination. One approach is to provide the last notification’s ID as the starting point:

#### References

*   **pageNotifications:**
    *   **notificationsPerPage:** Number representing how many notifications to get per fetch
    *   **isInfiniteScroll:** Whether or not to keep already fetched notifications when getting next page
    *   \*_params:_ (optional) Additional parameters
    *   **unreadFirst:** (optional, default `true`, since 1.3.0) Whether or not unread messages should be sorted at the top, regardless of timestamp
*   **onUpdate:**: A callback that will be called whenever notifications get updated
*   **nextPage:**: A function to be called to fetch the next page of notifications
*   **notifications:** Array of notifications, of type
*   **notification.markAsRead:** Mark the notification as read
*   **markNotificationsAsRead**: Takes an array of notification IDs and marks them as read. Max 1000 IDs
*   **markAllNotificationsAsRead**: Mark all notifications as read.

Notification Types
------------------

#### References

*   **update:** `(enabledScopeNames: string[]) -> void`
*   **types:** Map of scopes (Notification types)

Registering for Device Push Notifications
-----------------------------------------

If you wish to receive live push notifications to your React Native or Web app, you must integrate with Firebase Messaging. More information about how to integrate with Firebase can be found [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging).

Your integration will obtain a token from Firebase and you will need to pass this token to the Web3Inbox SDK using the `registerWithPushServer()` function.

#### References

*   `registerWithPushServer`: `(token: string, platform: 'fcm' | 'apns') => string`

Either APNS or FCM can be used to receive push notifications. Token here is the respective platform’s token.

Listening For Events
--------------------

This can be used to listen to, for example, messages received in realtime.

#### References

*   `message`: Notification of type:</content>

  <content>### enableAnalytics:

Enable analytics to get more insights on your users activity within your [Reown Cloud’s dashboard](https://cloud.reown.com/)

### siweConfig:

Used to configure [One-Click Auth + Sign In With Ethereum](https://docs.reown.com/appkit//flutter/core/siwe) feature.

Will be disabled automatically if you decide to support/include non-EVM blockchains.

### featuresConfig:

Used to configure extra features such [Email and Social Login](https://docs.reown.com/appkit//flutter/core/email).

### getBalanceFallback:

This callback method will be triggered if getting the balance from our blockchain API fails due to unsupported network. You may replace this with your own `getBalance()` method if desired.

### requiredNamespaces: and optionalNamespaces:

These are the set of namespaces that will be requested to the wallet you are connecting to.

These values are optionals and, in most cases, not required since AppKit already defines every required and optional namespace internally based on configured networks.

However, if you would want to override that definition with your own or support more networks than just EVM and Solana (i.e. Polkadot, Kadena, etc…) these are the object you should modify. See [Custom Networks](https://docs.reown.com/appkit//flutter/core/custom-chains). section.

### featuredWalletIds:

Allows to override default recommended wallets that are fetched from the API. You can define an array of wallet ids you’d like to prioritize (order is respected). You can find the wallets IDs in our [Wallets List](https://docs.reown.com/cloud/wallets/wallet-list).

### includedWalletIds:

Similar to `featuredWalletIds` this option allows you to determine exactly which wallets do you want to show. If `includedWalletIds` is set then only the wallets listed in this object are going to be displayed in the modal.

### excludedWalletIds:

Similar to `includedWalletIds` this option allows you to exclude a list of wallets from the API response.</content>

  <title>Link Mode - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit//flutter/core/link-mode</url>
  <content>AppKit Link Mode is a low latency mechanism for transporting One-Click Auth requests and session requests over Universal Links, reducing the need for a WebSocket connection with the Relay. This significantly enhances the user experience when connecting native dApps to native wallets by reducing the latency associated with network connections, especially when the user has an unstable internet connection.

By enabling it, the wallet and dapp will communicate through declared Universal Links on iOS and/or App Links on Android **even without an internet connection.**

### How to enable it:

1.  Add a Universal Link for your wallet in the **Explorer** tab of your [**Cloud project configuration**](https://cloud.reown.com/sign-in), under the **Mobile Linking** section
    
2.  Configure your `PairingMetadata`’s `redirect:` object with that Universal Link
    
3.  Set the `linkMode` property to `true`:
    

Once everything is properly configured, and the user interacts with a Link Mode-supporting Wallet, your dApp will receive responses through it.

In Flutter, there are several plugins that can help you integrate Universal/App Links. However, regardless of which one you choose, it is crucial that, when capturing an incoming link, you pass it to AppKit so it can process the request.

### How does it look without Link Mode?

### Platform specifics:

1.  Ensure that you handle incoming Universal Links in the appropriate methods of `AppDelegate` or `SceneDelegate`.
2.  Ensure that you have enabled the Associated Domains Capability in your XCode project and that your Universal Link is properly configured. _(Depending on the previous states of your Provisioning Profiles it may be necessary to update or create new ones)_

3.  Update/Create your domain’s `.well-known/apple-app-site-association` file accordingly.

For more information on how to configure universal links for your app, refer to the [Apple Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/allowing-apps-and-websites-to-link-to-your-content?language=swift).  
For a debugging guide, visit the [Debugging Universal Links](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3155-debugging-universal-links) page.  

You can check our Flutter’s AppKit sample [AppDelegate file](https://github.com/reown-com/reown_flutter/blob/master/packages/reown_appkit/example/base/ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift) as a reference.</content>

  <title>Usage - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit//flutter/core/usage#redirect-to-your-dapp</url>
  <content>Import the package:
-------------------

Create your `ReownAppKitModal()` instance, which is your primary class for opening, closing, disconnecting, etc.

Be sure to update the _project ID_ and _metadata_ with your own.

Initialization
--------------

In order to initialize `ReownAppKitModal()` instance you must provide a _projectId_ and a _metadata_.

Alternatively, `ReownAppKitModal()` allows you to create an instance by passing a `ReownAppKit()` object as follows:

The `metadata` object should contain your dApp’s name, description, url and icon. Redirect object is optional but _highly recommended_. See next session why.

Redirect to your dApp
---------------------

AppKit’s metadata object contains a `redirect` option that should be used by the wallet to redirected back to your dapp after connection.

But in order for the redirect mechanism to work you would also need to add the following in the iOS and Android native sides:

1.  Locate your `Info.plist` file under `your_project/ios/Runner/` folder.
2.  Locate the `<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>` section.
3.  Add your schema as `<dict>` entry within the `<array>` object as follows.

Available Buttons
-----------------

`AppKitModalConnectButton` to open modal and connect to a wallet or through social options

`AppKitModalNetworkSelectButton` to select an available network

`AppKitModalAccountButton` to open account screen once connected

`AppKitModalAddressButton` shows the address on the current selected network

`AppKitModalBalanceButton` shows wallet balance on the current selected network

To connect to a wallet you can either use `AppKitModalConnectButton` or `AppKitModalNetworkSelectButton`.

`AppKitModalNetworkSelectButton` will allow the user to pre-select a Network before connecting while `AppKitModalConnectButton` will directly show available wallets and social options.

Once connected, `AppKitModalConnectButton` will serve as Disconnect button while `AppKitModalAccountButton` will show basic account data such as balance and address and will be used to open Account screen.

Quick example:

`AppKitModalAccountButton` is composed by `AppKitModalBalanceButton` and `AppKitModalAddressButton` and you can use these separately from `AppKitModalAccountButton`

Custom Buttons
--------------

If you like you can also override AppKit’s buttons by using the `custom:` property as follows

`openModalView()` method can accept a “startWidget” argument that you can leverage to open specifics screens of the modal:</content>

  <title>One-Click Auth / SIWE - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit//flutter/core/siwe</url>
  <content>Sign In With Ethereum
---------------------

AppKit provides a simple solution for integrating with “Sign In With Ethereum” (SIWE), a new form of authentication that enables users to control their digital identity with their Ethereum account. SIWE is a standard also known as [EIP-4361](https://docs.login.xyz/general-information/siwe-overview/eip-4361).

_One-Click Auth_ represents a key advancement within WalletConnect v2, streamlining the user authentication process in AppKit by enabling them to seamlessly connect with a wallet and sign a SIWE message with just one click.

Connecting a wallet, proving control of an address with an off-chain signature, authorizing specific actions. These are the kinds of authorizations that can be encoded as [“ReCaps”](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5573). ReCaps are permissions for a specific website or dapp that can be compactly encoded as a long string in the message you sign and translated by any wallet into a straight-forward one-sentence summary. WalletConnect uses permissions expressed as ReCaps to enable a One-Click Authentication.

Pre-requisites
--------------

For 1-CA + SIWE to function properly, a backend for communication is required. This backend will be used to generate a nonce, verify messages and handle sessions. More info [here](https://docs.login.xyz/sign-in-with-ethereum/quickstart-guide/implement-the-backend)

Configure your SIWEConfig object
--------------------------------

Initialize ReownAppKitModal with your `siweConfig`
--------------------------------------------------

Add the siwe configuration in `ReownAppKitModal` initialization

### SIWEConfig reference

Exported functions
------------------

### `generateNonce`

Simple method to generate a timestamp-based nonce

### `formatMessage`

Creates [EIP-4361](https://docs.login.xyz/general-information/siwe-overview/eip-4361#informal-message-template) message based on input arguments.

### `verifySignature`

Verify a SIWE signature. Internally it calls your backend verification method.

### `getChainIdFromMessage`

Get the chain ID from the SIWE message.

### `getAddressFromMessage`

Get the address from the SIWE message.

Basic usage example
-------------------

This basic configuration is enough to try the feature out without a backend</content>

  <title>Custom Networks - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit//flutter/core/custom-chains</url>
  <content>Custom Networks addition and selection
--------------------------------------

AppKit Flutter supports EVM and Solana networks by default since _version 1.2.0_, meaning that you can connect to these networks with no extra configuration and it already comes with a predefined list of chains within the [ReownAppKitModalNetworks class](https://github.com/reown-com/reown_flutter/blob/develop/packages/reown_appkit/lib/modal/utils/public/appkit_modal_default_networks.dart).

This means that if you intend to support just EVM and Solana networks then no further adjustments are necessary.

However, with extra configuration to `ReownAppKitModalNetworks` and `optionalNamespaces` you can connect to whatever other network you’d like.

For instance, if you want to support also Polkadot blockchain then first add Polkadot to the supported networks list:

_Remember to do this before `ReownAppKitModal` instance configuration and to set `isTestNetwork: true` if you are adding a testnet_

Then modify/add `optionalNamespaces:` property in ReownAppKitModal instance as follows:

_When you set `optionalNamespaces` property you are overwriting the internal definition of it so it is important that you also include `eip155` and `solana` in this case. If you plan to support only EVM + Solana then this extra step is not needed as mentioned before_

`ReownAppKitModalNetworks` class also comes with handy methods to change the configuration of the supported networks list:

*   You can add more EVM networks

*   You can remove Solana networks if you don’t want to support it

*   You can remove test networks altogether

Configuration examples
----------------------

A list of different ways of configure `ReownAppKitModal()` instance to support different blockchains.

#### 1\. Default support (EVM + Solana blockchains)

#### 2\. Only EVM blockchains support

#### 3\. Only Solana blockchain support

#### 4\. Default support (EVM + Solana blockchains) + Polkadot + Tron

  <title>Email & Social Wallets - Reown Docs</title>
  <url>https://docs.reown.com/appkit//flutter/core/email</url>
  <content>AppKit enables passwordless Web3 onboarding and authentication, allowing your users interact with your application by creating a non-custodial wallet with just their emails or social accounts.

Integration
-----------

In order to support Email and Social Wallets creation just set `featuresConfig:` parameter in `ReownAppKitModal` initialization.

Options
-------

*   _**email `bool`**_ : This boolean defines whether you want to enable email login. Default `true`
*   _**socials `List<AppKitSocialOption>`**_ : This list contains the list of social platforms that you want to enable for user authentication. The platforms in the example include Farcaster, X, Discord. Is empty by default, it means that no social options is enabled.
*   **showMainWallets `bool`\_** : This boolean defines whether you want to show the main wallet options on the first connect screen. If this is `false` it will show a button that directs you to a new screen displaying all available wallets. Default `true`.

User Flow
---------

1.  Users will be able to connect to you application by simply using an email address. AppKit will send to them a One Time Password (OTP) to copy and paste in the modal, which will help to verify the user’s authenticity. This will create a non-custodial wallet for your user which will be available in any application that integrates AppKit and Email Wallets.
    
2.  Eventually the user can optionally choose to move from a non-custodial wallet to a self-custodial one by pressing “Upgrade Wallet” on AppKit. This will open the (Reown secure website) that will walk your user through the upgrading process.</content>
